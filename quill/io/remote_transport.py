"""Abstract base class and shared types for the remote file transports.

Four transport implementations live next to this file:

* :mod:`quill.io.ftp_transport`      — FTP via :mod:`ftplib`.
* :mod:`quill.io.sftp_transport`     — SFTP via :mod:`paramiko`.
* :mod:`quill.io.webdav_transport`   — WebDAV via :mod:`urllib` + :mod:`xml.etree`.
* :mod:`quill.io.s3_transport`       — S3 (object storage) via boto3 with a
                                       manual SigV4 fallback.

The transports all conform to :class:`RemoteTransport`. They are not used for
inline editing (that is File > SSH; see :mod:`quill.core.ssh.client`); they
are a *convenience retrieval path*. The transport is expected to copy bytes
between the remote host and a local :class:`tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile`, and
the higher-level :mod:`quill.io.open_read` pipeline is what understands the
resulting format. That keeps the editor's format-detection logic, the undo
stack, and the recovery layer all on a single code path.

Threading: every transport method is synchronous and meant to be called from
a background thread inside :class:`quill.stability.task_manager.QuillTaskManager`.
Progress callbacks (when supplied) are invoked on the same worker thread;
callers that want to update wx widgets must marshal the result through
``wx.CallAfter``.
