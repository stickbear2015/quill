"""Crash report and diagnostic bundle construction.

Implements: ROADMAP STAB-2 (the diagnostic-bundle path the user
chooses from Help > Save Diagnostics) and H-2/H-3 from the pre-release
review (redacted bundle; no document content in logs). The bundle
is built in two passes through :mod:`quill.stability.redaction` so
secrets and personally identifying information never leave the user
machine in plaintext, even when the user shares the bundle with
support.
