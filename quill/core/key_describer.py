"""Reverse keymap lookup for Key Describer mode (EDS-17).

Key Describer mode speaks the action a key would perform instead
of performing it. The reverse lookup from an accelerator string to a command id
is pure and lives here so it can be unit-tested without ``wx``; the UI layer is
responsible only for turning a live key event into an accelerator string.
