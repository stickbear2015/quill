"""NABCC (North American Braille Computer Code) character set and helpers.

The Braille Mode feature treats ``.brf`` / ``.brl`` / ``pef`` / ``.ueb``
files as plain ASCII text in NABCC, with three load-time guarantees:

1. A UTF-8 BOM at the start of the file is stripped (NABCC has no BOM
   concept). The caller is told whether a BOM was present so the UI can
   surface a one-time announcement.
2. The text is scanned for any character outside the NABCC range. The
   matching offsets are returned for the warning path; the bytes are
   *not* transformed. A BRF/BRL must be saved byte-for-byte (BR-012).
3. Line endings are detected as ``CRLF`` / ``LF`` / ``CR`` / mixed so the
   save path (BR-012) can preserve them.

This module is wx-free; it lives in ``quill/core`` and is imported by
``quill/io/open_read.py`` on the BRF read path. Strict-typed: mypy
``--strict`` must stay clean.
