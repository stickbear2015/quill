"""Decompression-bomb protection for ZIP-based document formats.

DOCX, XLSX, ODT, PPTX, EPUB, and Pages files are ZIP archives. A small crafted
archive can declare gigabytes of uncompressed content (a "zip bomb"), so this
module opens archives behind a guard that rejects any archive whose total
declared uncompressed size, or whose per-entry compression ratio, exceeds safe
limits before any entry is read.
