"""Parse Unicode code points for the Insert Special Character command (EDS-1).

Insert Special Character accepts a code point as hexadecimal, or
as decimal when prefixed with ``d``. This module is UI-framework agnostic so the
parsing can be unit-tested without ``wx``.

Migration note: the same logic is now vendored into
``quill/quillins_bundled/insert-character/codepoints.py`` so the feature can
run as a sandboxed Quillin (``ext.insert.character``) alongside the first-party
``power.insert_special_character`` command. When the first-party command is
retired (migration plan Wave N), this module can be removed.
