"""Consistent, screen-reader-friendly AI availability reporting (AI-6).

Every AI feature must announce clearly when a model is unavailable or an API key
is missing, and must never block the editor. This module is the single, wx-free
place that turns the three facts a caller has — whether the master AI toggle is
on, whether the active backend reports itself available, and the backend's
reason string — into one clear sentence the UI can speak.

Keeping the wording here (instead of scattered f-strings across the UI) means
the chat, the inline writing actions, the watch-folder actions, and the AI
status badge all describe the same problem the same way.
