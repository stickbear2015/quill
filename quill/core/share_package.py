"""Portable, privacy-safe profile and backup package format (SHARE-3).

This module defines the on-disk package that the Export/Back Up (SHARE-1) and
Import/Restore (SHARE-2) dialogs read and write. Two kinds exist:

* ``profile`` (``.quillprofile``) - a portable, privacy-scrubbed package meant
  to hand to a friend.
* ``backup`` (``.quillbackup``) - a full personal restore point for this device.

The privacy boundary is structural, not cosmetic. Every section is classified as
shareable or private; the writer *refuses* to emit a private section (or a
private field inside an otherwise-shareable section such as per-device paths)
into a profile package, and the reader strips any that a hand-edited file might
carry. A round-trip test and a privacy test enforce this.

No ``wx`` imports: this is pure model code consumed by the SHARE dialogs.
