"""BRF page map engine.

The page map splits a :class:`~quill.core.brf_document.BRFDocument` into
:const:`BRFPage` records. Two page-boundary strategies are supported:

1. **Form-feed aware** — every ``\x0c`` (FF) ends a page. The FF itself
   is part of the prior page (it is the terminator). This is the
   correct strategy for any BRF produced by a real transcription tool
   (Duxbury, BrailleBlaster, liblouis, etc.) and for the corpus
   fixture in ``tests/corpus/braille/one_crazy_night.brf`` (69 FFs,
   70 pages).
2. **Calculated** — when the file has no FFs, the page map falls back
   to a fixed grid: ``cell_width`` × ``line_height`` per page. Every
   ``line_height`` logical lines ends a page. This is the *last-resort*
   fallback for hand-edited or foreign BRFs that lost their FFs in
   transit. A file with no FFs and zero lines produces a single empty
   page so the status bar still has a position to announce.

This module is wx-free; it lives in ``quill/core`` and is consumed by
:mod:`quill.core.braille_position`, the status string composer, and the
UI status bar. Strict-typed: mypy ``--strict`` must stay clean.
