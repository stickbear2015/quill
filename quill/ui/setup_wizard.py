"""QUILL first-run setup wizard.

Shown automatically the first time QUILL launches
(``settings.setup_wizard_completed == False``).  Re-runnable from
Help > Personalise QUILL.

The wizard walks the user through nine pages and writes the result into
``Settings`` and ``FeatureManager`` before closing.  No feature is toggled
mid-wizard; all changes are applied atomically when the user clicks Finish.

Usage::

    from quill.ui.setup_wizard import run_setup_wizard
    changed = run_setup_wizard(parent, settings, feature_manager)
    if changed:
        # reload menu, announce profile change, etc.
        ...
