# Migrating QUILL's first-party code onto the Quillins contribution grammar

Status: **In progress — Wave 0 + Pilot 1 shipped; Host facade + Wave 2 line
transforms landed** · Companion to `docs/scripting.md` (esp. §16) and
`menus.md` (§3.7 + Phase 5) · Scope: **internal refactor, 2.0-scale,
maintainability-driven**

> Read `docs/scripting.md` §16 for the *why* (one vocabulary, two tiers). This
> document is the *how*: a concrete, low-risk, reversible procedure for moving
> built-in features out of the `quill/ui/main_frame.py` god object and onto the
> same **contribution grammar** (commands, menus, hotkeys, context-menu entries)
> that Quillins already use — turning `quill/core` into a genuine framework.

## 1. The one insight this plan rests on

The Quillins framework already defines, validates, and wires a contribution
vocabulary: a **command** (`id`, `title`, a handler), its placement in **menus**
and the **context menu**, and its **hotkey** binding, all merged with conflict
detection (`quill/core/quillins/registry.py`). QUILL's built-ins are wired with
*the same concepts*, but by hand, inline, inside one 20k-line class.

So the migration is not "rewrite features". It is: **express each existing
feature as a self-registering module that contributes commands through one host
facade**, and delete the corresponding hand-wiring from `main_frame.py`.

```
            ┌─────────────── one contribution grammar ───────────────┐
            │                                                         │
  first-party feature module                          third-party Quillin
  register(host)  ── rich, in-process host ──►   register(api) ── narrow, gated API
  (trusted, no sandbox)                           (untrusted, out-of-process, §6)
            │                                                         │
            └────────► same commands / menus / hotkeys / palette ◄────┘
```

The crucial rule (restated from §16.1, non-negotiable): **first-party modules run
in-process against a rich host facade. They are NEVER routed through the
sandboxed, capability-gated, out-of-process Quillin path.** That path exists for
*untrusted* code; forcing trusted per-keystroke built-ins across an RPC bridge
would wreck latency and capability for zero security gain.

## 2. Guardrails — what must NOT be migrated

These are load-bearing for QUILL's identity. Decomposing them is how
accessibility regresses (see §16.3):

- **The editor surface.** The plain-text `wx.TextCtrl` writing path stays a
  first-class, hand-owned widget. It is not a plugin and gets no `register(host)`.
- **The accessibility / announcement engine.** NVDA/JAWS/Narrator parity is the
  framework's central guarantee. It is *called by* migrated modules; it is not
  itself pluginized.
- **App lifecycle & frame construction.** Startup ordering, tab management, the
  single-instance guard, crash recovery, and the menu *bar* skeleton remain core.
- **Anything with deep shared-mutable-state coupling** that cannot be covered by
  a characterization test first (see §5). If you can't pin its behavior, you
  can't safely move it yet.

When in doubt: a feature is a migration candidate iff it is **command-shaped** —
it has a stable id, a title, a handler, and (optionally) a menu/hotkey/context
placement — and its handler can reach everything it needs through the host
facade (§4).

## 3. Target shape of a migrated module

A first-party feature module is a small, self-contained file exposing one
top-level `register(host)` that contributes its commands. It mirrors the Quillin
`register(api)` shape so the mental model is identical, but `host` is the **rich
trusted facade**, not the narrow capability-gated `QuillExtensionApi`.

```python
# quill/ui/features/line_ops.py  (illustrative target)
"""Line operations, migrated off main_frame.py onto the contribution grammar."""

from quill.core.contributions import Host  # the first-party host facade (§4)


def register(host: Host) -> None:
    host.add_command(
        id="lines.number",
        title="Number Lines",
        handler=_number_lines,
        menu=("Format",),          # optional placement
        context=("editor.hasText",),
        # no default hotkey: user binds via the Keymap Editor
    )


def _number_lines(ctx: Host) -> None:
    text = ctx.get_text()
    numbered = "\n".join(f"{i + 1}\t{line}" for i, line in enumerate(text.splitlines()))
    with ctx.undo_group("Number Lines"):
        ctx.set_text(numbered)
    ctx.announce("Numbered lines")
```

The module imports **no `wx`** directly for its *logic*; UI effects go through the
host facade, exactly as the Power Tools handlers already centralize their edits. (A
module may still live under `quill/ui/` and use `wx` for genuinely bespoke UI, but
that UI must pass A11Y-4 review — it is first-party, not a sandboxed extension.)

## 4. The first-party host facade

This is the single piece of *new* core surface the migration introduces, and both
halves have now **landed**. The registration half (Wave 0):
`quill/core/contributions.py` (wx-free) provides a `FirstPartyRegistrar` that
emits an `ExtensionManifest` merged through the shared `build_registry`. The
execution half (Wave 2): the same module defines the wx-free `Host` protocol —
`get_text`, `get_selection`, `is_read_only`, `set_status`, `announce`, `prompt`,
`transform_block` — implemented live by `MainFrameHost`
(`quill/ui/contribution_host.py`), a thin adapter that delegates to existing
`MainFrame` helpers so migrated handlers behave byte-for-byte like the inline
code they replace. The richer breadth below (more editor primitives, services) is
the trusted superset of `QuillExtensionApi`, filled in per wave as features move:

| Group | Methods (illustrative) | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Registration | `add_command`, `add_menu`, `add_context`, `add_hotkey` | Same grammar as `Contributions`; conflicts routed through `build_registry` |
| Editor read | `get_text`, `get_selection`, `get_cursor`, `get_lines` | |
| Editor write | `set_text`, `insert_text`, `replace_selection`, `undo_group(label)` | All writes go through core command + history (undoable) |
| Announce | `announce`, `set_status` | The one announcement engine; never bypassed |
| Services | `settings`, `document`, `dialogs.show_web_form`, `workers`, `platform` | Rich, synchronous, in-process — the trusted breadth |

Two design rules keep this honest:

1. **The registration quartet is shared with Quillins.** `add_command` /
   `add_menu` / `add_hotkey` feed the *same* `ContributionRegistry`
   (`quill/core/quillins/registry.py`) so first-party and third-party
   contributions collide-detect against each other and the host keymap uniformly.
   First-party ids are *not* forced under `ext.` — they keep their existing
   namespaces (`lines.*`, `power.*`, …); only third-party ids carry `ext.`.
2. **The breadth gap is the only difference between tiers.** `host` exposes
   settings/workers/platform/dialogs; `api` does not. That asymmetry *is* the
   trust boundary — there is no second registration mechanism, no second menu
   builder, no second keymap.

## 5. Strategy: strangler-fig, behind characterization tests

Never a big-bang "everything is a plugin" rewrite (§16.3). Each feature is moved
in a self-contained, individually revertible step:

1. **Pin behavior first.** Write/extend a characterization test that asserts the
   feature's *current* observable behavior (command id registered, menu present,
   handler output for representative input, announcement text). The existing
   `test_power_tools_command_wiring.py` is the template: it reads source text and asserts
   the wiring contract without constructing the full frame.
2. **Introduce the facade seam.** Land `quill/core/contributions.py` + its
   `MainFrame` adapter with **zero behavior change** — `main_frame.py` keeps
   working; the facade just wraps what it already does.
3. **Move one feature.** Extract its handler(s) into a `register(host)` module;
   replace the inline registration/menu/hotkey wiring in `main_frame.py` with a
   single `register(module, host)` call.
4. **Delete the old wiring.** The inline command registration, menu append, and
   handler body leave `main_frame.py`. The line count drops; the test stays green.
5. **Repeat.** One feature (or one cohesive mixin) per PR.

Rollback at any step is a single-file revert because each module is independent.

## 6. Pilot selection

Pick first movers that are **already command-shaped and already extracted into a
mixin**, so the migration is mechanical and the risk is near zero. The codebase
hands us an ideal pilot:

- **Pilot 1 — Power Tools (`power.*`).** `quill/ui/main_frame_power_tools_menu.py`
  already centralizes the commands as a `(id, label, handler)` table
  (`_power_tools_command_table`) and the handlers already live on one mixin
  (`PowerToolsActionsMixin`). That table *is* a contribution list in all but name —
  converting it to `host.add_command(...)` calls is a near-syntactic transform,
  and `test_power_tools_command_wiring.py` already pins the contract.

  **This pilot and the menu-consolidation plan are the same work.** `menus.md`
  §3.7 groups these under `Power Tools` and **recirculates** most of its
  commands into their conventional homes (Insert/Edit/Format/Search/Navigate/File
  and the Compare/Read-Aloud Tools submenus). Done by hand against today's inline
  `wx.Menu().Append(...)` wiring that is a fiddly, error-prone move across hundreds
  of lines. Done *through the contribution grammar* it is a **pure data edit**:
  each command already carries a `menu=(...)` placement tuple, so recirculating
  `power.number_lines` from the Power Tools submenu to `Format` is changing one tuple —
  the registry re-files it, the palette and Keymap Editor are untouched, and the
  collision detector still guards it. Migrate Power Tools first (Wave 1), then the
  menus.md §3.7 recirculation becomes the motivating, low-risk demonstration that
  "menus as data" works. The two plans should land together.
- **Pilot 2 — line operations & "speak …" commands.** Self-contained, pure-ish
  text transforms with clear announcements and no dialog dependencies.
- **Pilot 3 — formatting commands** that contribute under the `Format` menu.

Defer: anything touching tab lifecycle, the watch service, AI/assistant flows, or
shared mutable selection state until the facade has proven itself on Pilots 1–3.

## 7. Wave-by-wave sequencing

Status legend: ✅ shipped · ⏳ future.

| Wave | Scope | Exit criterion | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Land `quill/core/contributions.py` (wx-free facade: `FirstPartyRegistrar` + `FirstPartyCommand` + `build_first_party_registry`) feeding the **same** `build_registry` as Quillins | Facade unit-tested (`tests/unit/core/test_contributions.py`); `main_frame.py` unchanged in behavior; public-surface fixture stable | ✅ Shipped |
| 1 | Pilot 1 (Power Tools `power.*`) — **lands the menus.md §3.7 rename + recirculation as data** | Power Tools table + menu recirculation **derived from** the declarative `POWER_TOOLS_COMMANDS` manifest (each command carries its recirculated home Insert/Edit/Format/Search/Navigate/File or the renamed `Power Tools` remainder); `test_power_tools_command_wiring.py` reads the manifest and is green; live menu byte-for-byte identical | ✅ Shipped |
| 2 | Line-ops + speak/status commands | Each command a module; characterization tests green | 🔄 In progress — `Host` facade + adapter shipped; the line-transforms group (`power.number_lines`, `power.hard_wrap_lines`) migrated to `quill/ui/features/line_transforms.py` and removed from the mixin (§9 worked example). Remaining line/speak/status commands future |
| 3 | Format-menu commands | `Format` contributions all flow through the registry | ⏳ Future |
| 4 | Navigate/View read-only commands | … | ⏳ Future |
| 5 | Tools utilities that already use `show_web_form` | Dialogs stay A11Y-4-registered; `dialogs.md` rows unchanged | ⏳ Future |
| N | Re-evaluate; stop when `main_frame.py` is a thin shell of lifecycle + surface | `quill/core` is the framework; remaining `main_frame.py` is guardrail code (§2) | ⏳ Future |

Each wave is multiple small PRs, not one large one.

## 8. Per-feature migration checklist

For every feature moved:

- [ ] Characterization test pins current id(s), menu/hotkey placement, handler
      output, and announcement text **before** any move.
- [ ] New module exposes exactly one top-level `register(host)`.
- [ ] Logic reaches the editor/settings/announcer **only** through the host
      facade; no new direct `MainFrame` attribute reach-ins.
- [ ] All writes use `host.undo_group(...)` so behavior stays undoable and
      announced identically.
- [ ] Inline registration/menu/hotkey/handler code is **removed** from
      `main_frame.py` in the same PR (no dead duplicate).
- [ ] Command ids and bindings still collide-detect via the shared registry
      (no silently-overridden hotkey — §4 rule 1).
- [ ] If the feature owns a dialog: `dialog_inventory.json` regenerated, the
      A11Y-4 gate green, `dialogs.md` row unchanged (the dialog didn't move for
      the user, only in code).
- [ ] `ruff format`/`check` clean; strict `mypy` green on the new wx-free core
      facade and any `quill/core` touched; targeted `pytest` green.
- [ ] If a public `MainFrame` method disappeared, regenerate the public-surface
      fixture and review the diff.

## 9. Worked example — migrating `power.number_lines`

**Before** (conceptually, in `main_frame_power_tools_menu.py` + `PowerToolsActionsMixin`):

```python
# table row
("power.number_lines", "Number Lines", self.number_lines)
# registration loop calls self.commands.register(id, label, handler, binding)
# and the menu builder appends + binds the same id
```

**After** (`quill/ui/features/eds_line_ops.py`):

```python
def register(host):
    host.add_command(
        id="power.number_lines",
        title="Number Lines",
        handler=_number_lines,
        menu=("Format",),         # recirculated home (menus.md §3.7), not a deep
                                  # "Tools > Power Tools > Lines" chain
    )

def _number_lines(ctx):
    if ctx.is_read_only():
        ctx.set_status("Document is read-only")
        return
    ...                       # same body as today's PowerToolsActionsMixin.number_lines
    ctx.announce("Numbered lines")
```

and in `main_frame.py`, the Power Tools block collapses to:

```python
from quill.ui.features import eds_line_ops
eds_line_ops.register(self._contribution_host)
```

The user sees the command in its **new, conventional home** (Format, per
menus.md §3.7) instead of three levels deep under a single power-tools submenu — same palette entry, same key-bindability, same announcement.
The maintainer sees one fewer responsibility in the god object, a module they can
read in isolation, **and** the menu recirculation expressed as one `menu=` tuple
rather than hand-edited `wx.Menu` plumbing. The menu-consolidation win and the
god-object-shrink win arrive in the same diff.

> **✅ Shipped (Wave 2 first cut).** This example is real:
> `quill/ui/features/line_transforms.py` now owns the `power.number_lines` and
> `power.hard_wrap_lines` handlers as pure `host`-driven functions (no `wx`, no
> `MainFrame` reach-in); they were deleted from `PowerToolsActionsMixin`. The Power Tools
> registration table resolves those two ids to the feature handlers via the live
> `MainFrameHost`, while the declarative `POWER_TOOLS_COMMANDS` manifest still owns
> their `Format > Transform Lines` placement. Behaviour is verified identical by
> `tests/unit/ui/test_contribution_host.py` (fake-host logic) plus a live
> `MainFrame` smoke test; the full suite stays green. The remaining Power Tools groups
> are mechanical repeats of this same move.

## 10. Done criteria & honest limits

**Done looks like:** `quill/core` carries the document model, command registry,
keymap, event bus, feature gating, the announcement engine, **and** the shared
contribution registry + host-facade protocol; the majority of command-shaped
features live in self-registering modules; `main_frame.py` is a thin shell of
lifecycle, the editor surface, and guardrail code (§2).

**This refactor does not add user-facing capability.** Its justification is
maintainability and testability (§16.3). Feature profiles already deliver most of
the user-visible modularity, so this is sequenced **after** user-facing wins and
proceeds **opportunistically** — every wave must leave the suite green and the
accessibility contract intact, or it does not land.
