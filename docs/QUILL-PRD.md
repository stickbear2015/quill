# Quill: Product Requirements Document

## A magical, screen-reader-first writing and document environment, built in wxPython

Status: This document specifies Quill **1.0**. The current shipping build is **0.1.5 Beta**, which implements the v1.0 checklist (section 21.1–21.16) plus the post-1.0 foundation work in section 21.17 and later. Section 21 is the living implementation map and is kept current as features land.
Owner: Blind Information Technology Solutions (BITS) and Community Access
Target platform: Windows 10 and Windows 11
Target screen readers: NVDA (primary), JAWS, Narrator
UI framework: wxPython (wxWidgets 3.2 or newer)
Language: Python 3.12 or newer

## 1. Vision

Quill is a focused writing and document-reading workstation for blind and low-vision users. It opens almost anything, turns it into clean, navigable text in a familiar Windows edit field, and gives the writer a quiet, predictable place to think.

1. **Open by default.** Free, open source, with no proprietary scripting layer required. Works first class with NVDA out of the box, and equally well with JAWS or Narrator.
2. **Screen-reader-native.** Every surface is a standard Windows control (`wx.TextCtrl` multiline, `wx.ListBox`, `wx.Dialog`) so MSAA, UIA, IAccessible2 and braille routing all just work. No custom drawn controls in the writing path.
3. **Magical, not flashy.** "Magic" means the right thing happens without ceremony. PDFs become readable. Bookmarks survive edits. Backups are automatic. The command palette knows what you mean. Nothing surprises the screen reader.
4. **Local first, cloud optional.** Heavy lifting (PDF extraction, OCR, layout repair, spell checking) runs locally when possible. Cloud assistance is opt-in per action, transparent, and never silent.

If a sighted person watched a Quill user work, they would see almost nothing on screen. That is the point.

## 2. Goals and non-goals

### 2.1 Goals

- Provide a dependable plain-text writing surface that NVDA, JAWS and Narrator can read without quirks.
- Open a wide range of document formats and present them as editable text in a standard edit field.
- Preserve the original source file. Extracted or rendered text saves through "Save As" so originals are never overwritten.
- Offer practical writer tools: find and replace, bookmarks that survive edits, magical spell check, word count, page navigation, multiple documents, backups, recent files.
- Offer a discoverable command palette modelled on Visual Studio Code so users do not need to memorise every shortcut.
- Let every shortcut be reassigned through a friendly keymap editor.
- Offer optional, transparent AI assistance for awkward PDFs, scanned images and broken layouts.
- Integrate cleanly with Windows: file associations, "Open with", jump lists, taskbar.
- Be themable for low vision (high contrast, large fonts) without breaking screen-reader behaviour.

### 2.2 Non-goals

- Not a visual word processor. No bold, italic, fonts, colour styling in the writing surface for v1.
- Not a desktop publishing tool.
- Not a replacement for Microsoft Word or LibreOffice Writer.
- Not a book reader with pagination and reflow. Quill renders documents as editable text.
- Not an AI chat product. AI is used only to repair reading order or extract text.

### 2.3 Update Strategy and Micro-Updates

Quill uses `app_updater` (AccessibleApps, MIT license) for cross-platform incremental updates, enabling smaller, faster patches:

- **Incremental delivery**: Updates are distributed as small ZIP packages containing only changed files, not full reinstalls.
- **Automatic bootstrapper**: Platform-specific bootstrappers (`bootstrap.exe`, `bootstrap-mac.sh`, `bootstrap-lin.sh`) apply updates atomically after app exit and restart.
- **Accessible UX**: Update checks and progress are announced through the screen reader with clear prompts for user consent.
- **Backwards-compatible install**: Full installers (Inno Setup on Windows, `.dmg` on macOS) remain available for fresh installs or offline scenarios.
- **Signed feeds**: Update feeds are cryptographically signed (Ed25519 or RSA) to prevent tampering; signatures are verified client-side.

This enables shipping bug fixes and security patches as micro-updates without re-downloading the entire application, while maintaining security and platform best practices.

## 3. Target users and primary scenarios

### 3.1 Personas

1. **Mira, blind university student.** Reads PDF lecture notes daily. Needs them to make sense linearly, with reliable search and bookmarks she can name.
2. **Ade, blind technical writer.** Writes long Markdown and HTML. Wants to write in a quiet edit field, preview structure in a browser, and export cleanly.
3. **Pat, blind admin assistant.** Opens invoices and Word documents from email. Wants to copy reference numbers and totals quickly.
4. **Sam, low-vision novelist.** Uses Narrator with a large font and high contrast. Writes long manuscripts, restores from yesterday's backup occasionally.
5. **Jamie, blind sysadmin.** Edits INI, JSON, log and config files. Wants a calm editor that does not fight tooling.

### 3.2 Primary scenarios

- Open a 30-page PDF invoice, find the payment reference, copy it.
- Start a blank document, write a 2000-word article in Markdown, preview it in the browser, export to Word.
- Open a DOCX from a colleague, read it, save the extracted text as a `.txt` for archival without touching the original.
- Open a scanned receipt, ask Quill to OCR it through a cloud service, get a plain text rendering.
- Restore the version of `chapter-7.md` from two saves ago.
- Reassign `Ctrl+G` from Go To Line to Go To Bookmark because the user prefers a different convention.

## 4. Product principles

1. **The edit field is sacred.** The writing surface is a standard multi-line `wx.TextCtrl`. Nothing exotic. Screen readers see plain text. Always.
2. **Predictable keyboard.** Shortcuts match Windows conventions where they exist. New shortcuts are documented, discoverable, and reassignable.
3. **Speak the result, not the process.** After every meaningful action, Quill announces a short, useful result through the screen reader.
4. **Originals are read-only by default.** Anything rendered or extracted saves through Save As. Plain-text formats save in place.
5. **No silent network calls.** Any cloud assistance asks first, shows progress, and reports the outcome.
6. **Quiet by default.** No surprise toasts. No animated UI. No tabs that announce themselves on every switch.
7. **Recoverable.** Backups happen on save. Crash recovery on launch. Nothing the user wrote should ever be lost.
8. **Discoverable.** A searchable command palette lists every action with its current binding.

---

## 5. Functional requirements

### 5.1 Application shell

- Single window per running instance, with multiple documents inside.
- Three primary regions, always present: **menu bar** (5.1a), **central editor**, **status bar** (5.1b).
- Window title shows `document-name [modified] – Quill`. The word "modified" appears only when the document has unsaved changes.
- Tray icon optional, off by default.
- No splash screen.
- **Single-instance mode** is on by default. A second launch with a path opens that path in the existing window and brings it to the foreground. A setting allows multi-instance for advanced users.
- **F6 region cycling** moves keyboard focus through the three regions in order (editor → menu bar → status bar → editor). `Shift+F6` cycles in reverse. The region name is announced on entry ("Status bar"). If the Outline Navigator (5.16) is pinned, it joins the cycle between editor and menu bar.
- All regions are stock wx controls (`wx.MenuBar`, `wx.TextCtrl`, `wx.StatusBar` with a custom layout) so MSAA/UIA expose them correctly without scripts.

### 5.1a The magical menu bar

The menu bar is standards-based, predictable, and exhaustive. Every menu item is also a command in the palette, every item shows its current keybinding to the right of its label, and the displayed binding updates live when the user rebinds it. No menu item is hidden; disabled items remain visible with a short tooltip explaining why they are disabled in the current context.

Menu structure:

- **File**: New/Open/**New from Clipboard**/Open Recent/Open from URL, **Open from Remote / Save to Remote / Save Copy to Remote / Manage Remote Sites** (FTP, SFTP, HTTPS, WebDAV, S3 — verified TLS, host-allow-listed, explicit consent, screen-reader announcements), **Snapshots** (save/open workspace snapshot), **Notebook** submenu (**New Notebook / New from Folder / Open Notebook / Save Snapshot / Manage Snapshots** — multi-document workspace with entries panel, daily goal, and named snapshots), Save/Save As/Save All/Save as plain text, Reload/Restore backup, print flows, **Run current file / Open target at cursor / Rename / Delete current file**, close/exit.
- **Edit**: Undo/redo, clipboard (including **Paste HTML as Markdown**), **Find/Replace plus Find Next/Previous/All Matches**, selection helpers, **delete-to-line/document and delete-paragraph**, link insertion/follow, and **Recent Marks (Ring)** with plain-language labels.
- **View**: shell behavior, theme and visual controls (preference toggles such as persistent undo, spell-check-as-you-type, word prediction, dark mode, tray mode, title-path and dirty-title style now live in **Settings**).
- **Insert**: table/list/code/footnote/tag insertion helpers plus **special character, date and time, calculated date, and file content**.
- **Format**: case/comment/indent controls, rich text and heading controls, and a single **Transform Lines** submenu (number/hard-wrap lines plus sort/reverse/dedup/whitespace/indentation conversions).
- **Navigate**: line/page/bookmark movement, heading/block/structure movement, outline, bracket match, region movement, **go to percent / first / last non-blank**, and **Go to Entry / Heading / Bookmark / Sticky Note in Notebook** (cross-entry navigation when a Notebook is open).
- **Search**: in-files Find and Replace-across-files, plus **regex count/extract matches and block set-operations** (line filtering by block membership).
- **Tools**: regrouped into discoverable submenus (≤ 2 levels deep):
  - Sticky Notes
  - Writing and Language
  - Read Aloud
  - Integrations
  - Document Intake
  - AI Assistant *(demoted from top level; promotable back via Customize Menus)*
  - Authoring and Automation
  - GLOW
  - Macros
  - Compare Documents
  - Accessibility *(includes cursor address / document status / selection-length status queries)*
  - Support
  - Customize
  - Power Tools *(editor-behavior power toggles grouped together where no other menu is a natural home)*
  - Quillins *(includes **Text Tools** for line transforms/regex and **Insert Tools** for date/time placeholders)*
  - Dictation and Watch Folder Automation (BITS Whisperer) appears here when enabled.
- **Window**: document/tab management actions.
- **Help**: contextual help, onboarding docs, feature profile support, updates, and About.

All menu strings are translatable. Every menu item has a unique mnemonic. The menu bar may be hidden via View; when hidden, pressing `Alt` reveals it temporarily and `Esc` dismisses it again, matching Windows convention.

### 5.1b The magical status bar

The status bar is not a passive label strip. It is a fully keyboard-navigable row of items that any user can reach with `F6` and arrow through with Left and Right. Each item is a small interactive cell, and `Enter` on a cell either toggles a state, opens a chooser, or runs a related command. This is modelled on Visual Studio Code's status bar, adapted for screen-reader-first interaction.

Design rules:

- **Container**: a custom layout inside `wx.StatusBar` composed of small `wx.Window`-derived focusable buttons (`wx.lib.agw.AquaButton` style is rejected; we use plain `wx.Button` with flat styling). Each cell exposes itself as an MSAA button with name, role, value, and description so NVDA, JAWS, and Narrator read it as a real interactive control.
- **Reachable**: `F6` from the editor moves focus into the status bar at the cell the user last interacted with (or the leftmost cell on first entry). Left/Right arrow moves between cells with wrap-around. `Home`/`End` jump to first/last. `Esc` returns focus to the editor. Tab and Shift+Tab also move between cells inside the status bar.
- **Announced**: when focus enters the status bar, the region name and the focused cell are announced ("Status bar, Line 12, Column 7, button"). Cells announce their value when arrowed to.
- **Activated**: `Enter` or `Space` triggers the cell's primary action. `Shift+F10` or the Application key opens a context menu of related actions for that cell. Right-clicking is equivalent.
- **Live updates**: cell values update without stealing focus. Updates marshal via `wx.CallAfter` and use a debounced single accessibility event per cell per 200 ms to avoid speech spam.
- **Hideable per cell**: a context menu item "Hide this item" tucks any cell behind an overflow group. Overflow is reached at the right end ("More items, button"); Enter opens a small list of hidden cells, any of which can be restored.
- **Plugin-extensible** (v1.1): plugins may register status-bar cells with the same MSAA contract.

Cells shipped in v1.0, in left-to-right order:

| Cell | Default value | Primary action (Enter) | Context menu |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Document name** | `chapter-7.md` or `Untitled 1` | Opens Quick Switcher (palette `~`) | Switch document, Reveal in Explorer, Copy Path, Close |
| **Modified state** | `Modified` / `Saved` | Save | Save, Save As, Reload From Disk, Restore Backup |
| **Line / Column** | `Line 12, Column 7` | Opens Go To Line | Go To Line, Go To Page, Go To Bookmark |
| **Selection** | `Selection: 3 lines, 47 words` or hidden when no selection | Opens Document Statistics on selection | Statistics on selection, Convert case…, Sort selected lines |
| **Word count** | `1,248 words` | Opens Document Statistics on document | Statistics, Configure reading rate |
| **Page** | `Page 4 of 23` (only when document has page markers) | Opens Go To Page | Next page, Previous page, Page list |
| **Search term** | `Find: "reading order"` (only when a search term is set) | Opens Find with the term pre-filled | Find Next, Find Previous, Find All, Clear Search |
| **Encoding** | `UTF-8` | Opens Reload With Encoding | Reload With Encoding, Save With Encoding, Auto-detect |
| **Line endings** | `LF` / `CRLF` / `CR` | Cycles to the next style and prompts to confirm | Choose explicitly, Convert on save |
| **Indent** | `Spaces: 4` / `Tabs` | Opens indent settings | Convert to tabs, Convert to spaces, Set width |
| **Language** | `en-GB + tech + personal` (the active spell-check dictionary stack) | Opens dictionary stack chooser | Add dictionary, Pin to document, Per-paragraph (v1.2) |
| **Spell check** | `Spell check on` / `Spell check off`. When errors exist: `3 errors` | Toggles as-you-type spell check | Run spell check, Jump to next misspelling, Reset learning |
| **Read aloud** | `Read aloud: ready` or `Read aloud: speaking` | Toggles read-aloud playback | Voice…, Speed…, Read selection, Read document |
| **Accessibility audit** | `Audit: clean` or `Audit: 2 warnings` (only after a manual or auto audit) | Opens the Issues panel | Run audit, Configure rules, Ignore for this document |
| **AI status** | `AI: Ready` / `AI: Needs attention` / `AI: Not checked`, with a short detail line | Opens AI provider settings | Verify connection, Switch provider, View last response |
| **Background tasks** | `Idle` or `Extracting PDF, 42%` | Opens a small Tasks dialog listing in-flight operations with Cancel | Cancel all, Show task log |
| **Notifications** | `No new messages` or `2 messages` | Opens the Notifications dialog (release notes, available updates, backup recovery offers) | Dismiss all, Open Notifications |
| **Quill** (rightmost) | `Quill 1.0` | Opens About | Check for Updates, Release Notes |

Default visibility: Document name, Modified state, Line/Column, Word count, Encoding, Line endings, Spell check, Background tasks, Notifications. Other cells are present but tucked into overflow until first relevant use; they auto-surface when their context becomes relevant (for example Page appears as soon as a paged document is opened; Search term appears the moment a search term is set).

When title mode is configured to show the full file path, Quill suppresses a duplicate file-path status item to avoid repeated location noise.

### 5.1c Trust and verification

Quill explains what it did, how confident it is, and how to recover if extraction looked wrong.

- **Document Intake Report**: every non-plain-text open announces a short, screen-reader-friendly summary and exposes a full report with format, engine, page/sheet/slide counts, OCR use, AI use, confidence, detected structures, and sidecar path.
- **Copy With Source**: selected text can be copied with source location appended (file, page/line/column, engine, confidence) and the source map stays available for future citations.
- **Extraction quality review**: PDF-derived documents expose page-by-page confidence warnings and allow retry/review flows.
- **Cleanup recipes**: deterministic review-and-apply transforms for OCR/PDF cleanup (dehyphenate, remove headers/footers, normalize ligatures, line reflow).
- **Report Bad Extraction**: creates a support package with version, metadata, and no document content unless the user explicitly opts in.
- **What Can I Do Here?**: context-sensitive help for the current surface, available from the Help menu and command palette.
- **Safe mode**: a startup-safe mode disables plugins, experimental features, AI integrations, startup restore, background indexing, file watchers, custom themes, custom snippets, and network services for troubleshooting.
- **Portable mode clarity**: portable builds can store settings locally next to Quill.exe or in AppData, with a first-run choice and an independence command.
- **Golden document corpus**: release testing includes a canonical corpus of PDFs, DOCX, XLSX, PPTX, EPUB, Markdown, HTML, and OCR samples with expected extraction and announcement snapshots.

### 5.1f Profile safety and recovery

Feature profiles must be safe, explainable, reversible, and recoverable.

- **Why don’t I see this?** explains why a named feature is hidden, quiet, unavailable, or gated by the current profile.
- **Profile switch preview** shows visible, quiet, and off features before applying a profile change.
- **Undo last profile change** is available from Notifications after a profile switch.
- **Emergency reset to Essential** is available from launch and from the recovery flow.
- **Profile health check** validates feature IDs, dependencies, visibility paths, and profile JSON integrity.
- **Feature-coverage gate** fails CI when commands, menus, cells, pages, or help topics lack a valid feature ID.
- **Profile-aware keyboard reference** can filter to current profile, quiet features, off features, or diff views.
- **Profile-aware welcome guide** adapts onboarding to the active profile.
- **Privacy and network labels** declare local-only, external-helper, metadata-only, and network-sending features.
- **Feature maturity labels** distinguish core, stable, advanced, helper-required, and unavailable features.
- **Profile import safety** schema-validates profiles and prevents silent enablement of recovery-sensitive features.
- **Show what changed** produces a plain-text summary after profile switches.

### 5.1g Feature registry and user profiles

Quill’s feature-profile system is a first-class product surface, not a cosmetic preference layer.

- **Feature Registry**: a central registry assigns every feature an id, category, description, default state, dependencies, conflicts, privacy impact, network impact, accessibility notes, and profile tags.
- **Profile layering**: user overrides sit above custom profiles, shipped profiles, default registry state, and locked safety rules.
- **Shipped profiles**: Essential, Writer, Reader and Student, Office and Admin, Accessibility Professional, Developer and Power Text, Low Vision, Braille and Screen Reader Power User, Full Quill, and Custom.
- **Settings UI**: Profiles and Features page with search, feature table, explain/related commands, compare profiles, and profile management actions.
- **Custom profile creation**: users can create named custom profiles, select a parent shipped profile, and optionally inherit that parent's feature baseline.
- **Bare-bones start**: custom profile creation also supports an explicit non-inherited baseline (locked core safety features only), with a warning before commit.
- **Quick profile picker**: `Alt+Shift+P` opens fast switching for built-in and custom profiles.
- **Onboarding**: first run asks how Quill should start and chooses a profile.
- **Command/menu/status/help integration**: feature IDs govern command palette, menus, status-bar cells, settings rows, help topics, and format handlers.
- **Dependency enforcement**: enabling a feature can enable required dependencies; disabling a feature warns about affected features.
- **Storage**: feature flags and profiles are stored locally as JSON and can be imported/exported safely.
- **Safety rules**: locked-on features cannot be disabled by shipped profiles, custom profiles, imported profiles, plugins, or user overrides.
- **Feature metadata**: each feature declares risk, maturity, privacy, and network labels for use in settings and help.

### 5.1d Power search, regex, and special characters

Search and Unicode cleanup are first-class accessibility features, not power-user extras.

- **Search modes**: Find, Find All, Replace, Replace All, Find in Selection, and saved search recipes support plain text, whole word, regular expression, and wildcard modes.
- **Regex helper**: a screen-reader-friendly helper provides recipe presets, plain-language explanations, editable sample text, live match previews, and copy-pattern actions.
- **Plain-English errors**: regex errors are reported in single-sentence form with character positions and no traceback.
- **Match review**: users can review captured groups for a match, including named groups.
- **Replace preview**: Replace All shows a preview before applying, with undo as one step.
- **Saved searches**: common search/replace recipes can be stored with mode, scope, and description.
- **Special characters**: the Find dialog can insert special search tokens for tabs, line endings, non-breaking spaces, zero-width characters, smart quotes, ellipses, bullets, and Unicode character classes.
- **Character Inspector**: reports the character under the cursor by name, code point, category, and common encodings.
- **Invisible character view**: users can switch to an inspection view that describes invisible characters textually.
- **Unicode cleanup**: normalization and cleanup commands remove or rewrite common noisy characters with a preview first.

Menu and window stability requirement:

- **Menu mutation guard**: while native menus are open, Quill defers menu label/check/enable mutations and applies them on menu close. This avoids crash-prone churn during rapid keyboard menu navigation.

### 5.1e Feature flags and profiles

Quill should stay calm by default and unlock power features intentionally.

- **Feature states**: `on`, `quiet`, `off`, `locked on`, `locked off`.
- **Core stays locked on**: editor, open/save, backups, crash recovery, help, accessibility announcements, settings.
- **Advanced features can be quiet/off**: regex search, regex helper, saved searches, OCR, AI repair, document intake reports, extraction review, character tools, compare/diff helpers, diagnostics, plugin surfaces.
- **Profiles**: Essential, Writer, Reader and Student, Office and Admin, Accessibility Professional, Developer and Power Text, Low Vision, Braille and Screen Reader Power User, Full Quill, Custom.
- **Settings**: a Profiles and Features page lets the user switch profiles, compare them, and expose quiet features when desired.
- **Command/menu gating**: menus, palette entries, status-bar cells, help topics, and settings pages only surface features appropriate to the active profile.

### 5.2 Documents and the editor

- The editor is a multi-line `wx.TextCtrl` with `wx.TE_MULTILINE | wx.TE_RICH2 | wx.TE_NOHIDESEL | wx.TE_AUTO_URL`. `wx.TE_RICH2` is used only for selection and undo behaviour, not styling.
- UTF-8 internally. Line endings preserved on open, normalised to platform default on new documents.
- Soft wrap on by default; toggle with `Alt+Z`.
- Standard editing: cursor movement, selection, clipboard, undo and redo, all via the native edit control.
- `Ctrl+Delete` deletes the next word; `Ctrl+Backspace` deletes the previous word; result announced.
- Case conversion: `Ctrl+U` upper, `Ctrl+L` lower, `Ctrl+Shift+T` title. Selection if present, otherwise whole document.
- Multiple documents: `Ctrl+Tab` and `Ctrl+Shift+Tab` cycle. Switching announces document name only.
- Close current document: `Ctrl+W` or `Ctrl+F4`. Prompt to save if modified.
- Exit: `Alt+F4` or `Ctrl+Q`. Prompts for each modified document.
- Quill does not restore previous documents on launch by default. Opt-in setting available.

### 5.2a QUILL Quick Nav mode

Quill provides a browse-style, cursor-only navigation mode for long-form reading and structural movement in editable text surfaces.

- Activation: `Ctrl+Shift+Grave` enters QUILL Quick Nav mode.
- Exit: `Esc` exits QUILL Quick Nav mode.
- Direction rule: pressing `Shift` with a Quick Nav key reverses direction.
- Editing rule: no editing commands run while Quick Nav mode is active.
- Status rule: status bar reports Quick Nav mode state while active.
- Auto-exit rule: find and replace entry points return to normal command mode automatically.

Default Quick Nav keys:

- `H` / `Shift+H`: next and previous heading.
- `1` to `6` / `Shift+1` to `Shift+6`: next and previous heading at level 1 through 6.
- `A` / `Shift+A`: next and previous link anchor.
- `L` / `Shift+L`: next and previous list container.
- `I` / `Shift+I`: next and previous list item.
- `T` / `Shift+T`: next and previous table.
- `Q` / `Shift+Q`: next and previous block quote.
- `B` / `Shift+B`: next and previous bookmark.
- `'` / `Shift+'`: next and previous code block.
- `C`: open table of contents (outline navigator).
- `P` / `Shift+P`: next and previous paragraph.
- `S` / `Shift+S`: next and previous sentence.
- `Tab` / `Shift+Tab`: next and previous block.

Artifact tracking model:

- Quill maintains an in-memory navigation index per active document.
- Index key: full document text plus markup kind.
- Headings: parsed from Markdown and HTML heading structure.
- Links: indexed from Markdown link forms and HTML anchor tags.
- Lists: indexed from Markdown list block starts and HTML `ul`/`ol` tags.
- List items: indexed from Markdown list markers and HTML `<li>` tags.
- Tables: indexed from Markdown table starts and HTML `<table>` tags.
- Block quotes: indexed from Markdown quote starts and HTML `<blockquote>` tags.
- Code blocks: indexed from Markdown fenced code boundaries and HTML `<pre>`/`<code>` tags.
- Bookmarks: indexed from active bookmark positions.
- Paragraph anchors: blank-line paragraph boundaries for text/Markdown; block-level HTML tags (`p`, `li`, `blockquote`, `pre`, `h1` to `h6`, `td`, `th`) for HTML.
- Sentence anchors: sentence-ending punctuation boundaries.

Performance and invalidation:

- Quick Nav movement reuses cached anchors to avoid reparsing per keystroke.
- Index invalidates when document text changes, when full-text replacement occurs, and when active tab changes.
- Missing-target announcements are plain-language and surface-aware (for example, "No list items found in this HTML document").

Customization:

- Settings include wrap behavior for Quick Nav boundary traversal and feedback mode (`speech`, `sound`, `both`, `none`).
- Keyboard manager can reassign Quick Nav actions and leader sequences.

  - **Chat and transcript exports**: WhatsApp `.txt` exports, Telegram `.json`/`.html` exports, Slack export JSON, Discord JSON exports, Teams transcript `.docx`/`.vtt`, Zoom `.vtt`/`.txt`, Otter `.txt`, ChatGPT export `.json` (rendered as linear conversation).
  - **DAISY and accessible publishing**: `daisy` (2.02, 3), `nimas`, `bbeb`, `pef` (braille). Read as plain text with section markers.
  - **Braille files**: `brf`, `brl`, `pef`, `ueb` (with optional back-translation to print via liblouis).
  - **Audio with transcripts** (transcript only): pairs of `.mp3`/`.wav`/`.m4a`/`.opus` with a sibling `.vtt`/`.srt`/`.txt` are opened as the transcript with playback shortcuts via plugin.
  - **Image with OCR** (opt-in OCR, local by default via Tesseract, AI escalation available): `png`, `jpg`/`jpeg`, `tif`/`tiff`, `bmp`, `webp`, `heic`, `avif`, `gif`, `jp2`. Multi-page TIFF supported.
  - **Scanned documents**: `djvu`, `cbz`/`cbr`, multi-page TIFF, image-only PDFs (handled by the PDF pipeline).
  - **Subtitle bundles in containers**: `mkv`/`mp4` (extract embedded text tracks only; no media playback).
  - **Web archives**: `warc`, `wacz`, single-file `.html` saves from browsers, `webarchive` (Safari, best-effort).
  - **Code-block exchange**: GitHub Gist URLs and `.gist.json`, Pastebin `.txt`, snippet bundles.
- `Ctrl+S` saves. For editable text formats, saves in place. For rendered/extracted formats, opens Save As.
- `Ctrl+Shift+S` opens Save As directly.
- Recent files: last N (default 10, range 5 to 50). If empty, announce "No recent files."
- File Explorer integration: settings panel lets the user register Quill with Windows for chosen extensions and add an "Open with Quill" verb.

### 5.3a Extended format support

The table below lists every format family Quill adds, why each matters, and how Quill renders it. Every renderer follows the same rules: present text in a standard edit field, preserve the original file, escalate to the enhanced extractor or AI repair only when local extraction is poor and the user asks.

| Format family | Specific formats added | Why it matters | How Quill renders it |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Spreadsheets** | `xlsx`, `xlsm`, `xls`, `ods`, `numbers`, `csv`, `tsv` | Blind users routinely receive spreadsheet attachments; current accessible tooling forces Excel | Each sheet becomes a section. Tables are emitted as accessible plain-text columns with header row, `Ctrl+Shift+Right/Left` navigates by column, `Ctrl+Shift+Down` summarises totals |
| **OpenDocument** | `odt`, `odp`, `odg`, `ods` | Common in EU public sector and academia | Direct extractor via `odfpy`; structure preserved as headings, lists, tables |
| **Apple iWork** | `pages`, `key`, `numbers` | Cross-platform collaboration is increasingly common; iWork files arrive in email frequently | Local extractor via the iWork archive format; AI escalation for complex layouts |
| **Legacy office** | `ppt`, `xls`, `wpd`, `wps`, `wri`, `sxw`/`sxc`/`sxi` | Older institutional archives still circulate | Best-effort local readers; AI escalation by sending the original file when local reading fails |
| **E-books (proprietary)** | `azw`, `azw3`, `mobi`, `kfx`, `fb2`, `lit`, `lrf`, `prc`, `pdb`, `tcr` | EPUB-only support excludes most Kindle and older e-book libraries | Reuse Calibre's conversion engine where present (plugin in v1.1) or bundled minimal readers for the open formats |
| **Comics with text** | `cbz`, `cbr` | Educational comics and graphic textbooks ship in CBZ | Extract pages, OCR each, present per-page text with page navigation |
| **DjVu and XPS** | `djvu`, `xps`, `oxps` | Academic scans (DjVu) and Microsoft alternatives to PDF (XPS) are common in research | Local extractors; PDF-style page navigation |
| **PostScript** | `ps`, `eps` | Academic preprints and older typeset documents | Convert via Ghostscript to text + page markers |
| **TeX and Typst** | `tex`, `latex`, `bib`, `bibtex`, `typ` | Academic and scientific writing community is largely TeX-based; no accessible plain editor handles it gracefully | Plain-text editing with optional rendered preview to PDF/HTML via local engines; bibtex entries readable as structured records |
| **Lightweight markup** | `rst`, `adoc`/`asciidoc`, `textile`, `org`, `wiki`/`mediawiki`, `bbcode` | Documentation toolchains for Python, Ruby, Asciidoctor, Emacs Org-mode, wikis | Plain-text editing; preview via the appropriate renderer; export to HTML/DOCX |
| **DAISY and braille** | `daisy` 2.02/3, `nimas`, `brf`, `brl`, `pef`, `ueb` | Accessible publishing standards that ironically lack accessible editors. Braille files need round-trip print/braille translation | Linear text presentation with chapter/section navigation; liblouis for braille back-translation; export to BRF |
| **MHTML and web archives** | `mhtml`/`mht`, `warc`, `wacz`, browser "single file" saves, Safari `.webarchive` | Saved web pages are the second-most common research artefact after PDF | Extract the primary document; show resources list; allow Preview as HTML |
| **SVG** | `svg` | SVG is text; titles, descriptions, and `<text>` content carry semantic meaning often inaccessible elsewhere | Show as XML in edit field plus a "Reading View" that extracts titles, descriptions, and text in document order |
| **Subtitles (full set)** | `sbv`, `ass`/`ssa`, `sub`, `ttml`/`dfxp`, `scc`, `stl`, `cap` | broadcast and YouTube captioners need the rest | Render as plain text with optional timecode column; export between formats |
| **Email and mail archives** | `eml`, `msg`, `mbox`, `pst` | Email frequently arrives as standalone files (forwarded, archived, exported); `.msg` and `.pst` are pure Microsoft and historically painful | Headers as a labelled block, body as plain text, attachments listed with "Open in Quill" actions; `pst` and `mbox` get an index UI |
| **Calendar and contacts** | `ics`, `vcf` | Common attachments; today opened by heavy apps | Render events and contacts as structured plain text records |
| **Notes ecosystems** | `one`, `enex`, Apple Notes export, `bear`, Simplenote JSON | People have years of notes locked in proprietary apps | Read-only renderers; each note opens as its own document |
| **Source code and config** | Full polyglot list in 5.3 | Programmers and sysadmins use Quill for quick edits; the screen-reader story for VS Code is good but heavyweight | Syntax-aware tokeniser informs spell check and word navigation; presentation remains plain text |
| **Build, package, IaC** | `Dockerfile`, `*.tf`, `*.bicep`, `*.k8s.yaml`, `pyproject.toml`, etc. | DevOps work is text-heavy and benefits from a calm reader | Plain text with section folding via shortcut, schema-aware error reporting in the `!` palette mode |
| **Diff and patch** | `diff`, `patch`, `gitconfig`, `gitignore` | Code review and merge work | Hunks rendered with `+`/`-` summarised aloud; `Ctrl+]` next hunk |
| **Notebooks** | `ipynb`, `qmd`, `rmd` | Data science and research; notebooks are JSON and unreadable in basic editors | Linearised: each cell becomes a section with role header ("Code cell 3", "Markdown cell 4", "Output of cell 3"), outputs included where text |
| **Data files** | `sqlite`/`db`, `parquet`, `feather` | Researchers and analysts frequently inspect data files | Read-only schema view + first N rows as a table; refuses to edit and explains why |
| **Logs and trace** | `evtx`, gzipped logs, single-file archives | Sysadmin and support workflows | Auto-extract; render with timestamp column |
| **Web feeds** | `rss`, `atom`, `opml`, `json-feed` | Accessible feed consumption | Render as a list of articles, Enter to open one |
| **Chat exports** | WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack, Discord, Teams, Zoom, Otter, ChatGPT | People archive conversations and need to search them | Linearised conversation with speaker headers, timestamps optional |
| **Image OCR** | `png`, `jpg`, `tif` (multi-page), `bmp`, `webp`, `heic`, `avif`, `gif`, `jp2`, plus `djvu` and scanned PDFs | Photographed receipts, signage, scanned mail | Local Tesseract OCR by default; AI escalation for handwriting or poor scans |
| **Audio with transcript** | `.mp3`/`.wav`/`.m4a`/`.opus` paired with `.vtt`/`.srt`/`.txt` | Podcasts, lectures, interviews with transcripts | Opens the transcript; optional playback plugin syncs cursor to audio |
| **Code-block exchange** | Gist URLs, Pastebin URLs, snippet bundles | Developers share text via URLs daily | One-shot fetch + open as unsaved document |

Some renderers (notably KFX, PST, legacy proprietary office, and some iWork variants) require optional helper tools installed locally. Quill detects what is present at startup and the Open dialog only advertises formats it can actually read on this machine. The long-term design is a full Settings → Format Support page; the current beta already ships an External Tools and Format Support dialog that shows supported helpers, the capabilities they unlock, and copy-to-clipboard installation hints (never an automatic install).

#### Editable vs. read-only matrix

Not every format we open is something a user should edit. Quill is explicit about which formats round-trip in place vs. require Save As:

- **Save in place**: every plain-text and lightweight-markup format, source code, configs, subtitles, braille (BRF), SVG, JSON/XML/YAML/TOML, notebooks (when the user has explicitly chosen to keep notebook structure on save).
- **Save As only (originals protected)**: DOCX/DOC, PPTX/PPT, XLSX/XLS, ODT/ODP/ODS, Pages/Keynote/Numbers, PDF, PS/EPS, XPS, EPUB and other e-books, RTF, DjVu, comics, MHTML and web archives, email (`eml`, `msg`, `pst`, `mbox`), calendar and contact files, OneNote, data files (`sqlite`, `parquet`, `feather`), all image formats.
- **Read-only with explicit refusal-to-edit message**: PST archives, parquet/feather, evtx, AZW3/KFX, anything DRM-protected.

#### Plugin escalation

Where bundling a large dependency would balloon installer size (Calibre, Ghostscript, Tesseract trained-data packs, MeCab for Japanese, LibreOffice headless for legacy office), Quill ships a thin shim and offers a one-click plugin install from the Format Support page. Plugins announce their license clearly before installing.

### 5.3b Microsoft Word document support (DOCX / DOC)

This section is the canonical, scoped statement of what Quill 1.0 does with Microsoft Word files (.docx and .doc). Anything not listed here is explicitly out of scope for v1.0 and tracked in the backlog.

#### 5.3b.1 Complexity and Risk Context

Microsoft Word documents (.docx = XML-based, .doc = binary OLE2 format) present genuine complexity risks:

1. **Formatting metadata**: fonts, sizes, colors, styles, themes, templates
2. **Complex structure**: headers, footers, text boxes, shapes, comments, tracked changes
3. **Media embedding**: images, charts, SmartArt, embedded objects, videos
4. **Advanced features**: fields, macros (VBA), content controls, form controls, ActiveX
5. **Reading order challenges**: columns, text boxes in non-linear positions, floating shapes
6. **Legacy cruft**: corrupted documents, OLE objects, mixed encodings, malformed XML

Quill's design principle ("The edit field is sacred") prevents visual formatting preservation in v1.0. Word files must be extracted to plain, linear text in `wx.TextCtrl` for guaranteed screen-reader compatibility with NVDA, JAWS, and Narrator.

#### 5.3b.2 Supported Features (What Gets Extracted)

**Core content (via Pandoc extraction):**

- ✅ Body text and paragraphs
- ✅ Headings (levels 1–6) → rendered as Markdown `#`, `##`, `###`, etc.
- ✅ Bullet and numbered lists (nested up to 3 levels)
- ✅ Hyperlinks → preserved as plain-text URLs or Markdown links
- ✅ Comments and tracked changes → extracted as plain text with attributions
- ✅ Footnotes and endnotes → appended as footnote text
- ✅ Tables → converted to plain-text table representation (Markdown or ASCII)
- ✅ Page breaks → rendered as visual markers `--- Page Break ---`
- ✅ Basic structural integrity: proper paragraph separation, list context

**Conversion support (via Pandoc bridge):**

- ✅ Word → Markdown (for universal editing)
- ✅ Word → HTML (for preview/export)
- ✅ Word → Plain text
- ✅ Word → RTF (via Pandoc if needed)
- ✅ Cross-format roundtrip: Markdown ↔ Word, HTML ↔ Word

**Metadata (stored in `Document.source_metadata`):**

- ✅ Document title, author, subject
- ✅ Creation/modification dates
- ✅ Word count, page count (if available)
- ✅ Character encoding detection and preservation
- ✅ Extraction engine name and version (Pandoc 3.1+)
- ✅ Quality score (0–100) quantifying extraction fidelity

#### 5.3b.3 Unsupported Features (Not Extracted, User Warned)

**Formatting (intentionally dropped for v1.0 compatibility):**

- ❌ Font names, sizes, colors, bold/italic/underline
- ❌ Paragraph alignment (left, center, right, justify)
- ❌ Line spacing, paragraph spacing, indentation
- ❌ Themes, master pages, custom styles
- ❌ Watermarks, page backgrounds

**Advanced structures (extracted with limitations or skipped):**

- ⚠️ **Images**: Filenames and captions only; image content is NOT OCR'd unless user opts in v1.1+
- ⚠️ **Charts**: Extracted as text labels only; visual data is lost
- ⚠️ **Text boxes and shapes**: Attempted extraction; may appear out of order or be skipped
- ⚠️ **Headers and footers**: Extracted, appended as a section at end of document
- ⚠️ **Columns**: Flattened to single column; reading order may be unpredictable

**Security-sensitive (explicitly blocked or sanitized):**

- ❌ **VBA macros**: Silently ignored; Pandoc subprocess does not execute any code
- ❌ Embedded executables or ActiveX controls
- ❌ External links to remote templates or resources (not followed)
- ❌ OLE embedded objects (attempted extraction of embedded text only)

**Deferred to v1.1+ (not attempted in v1.0):**

- ❌ Revision history or multi-user collaboration metadata
- ❌ Form fields and fillable controls
- ❌ Custom numbering or multi-level list hacks
- ❌ Mail merge fields
- ❌ Document protection or permissions (file access checked by OS only)

#### 5.3b.4 Architecture: I/O Module Design

**New module: `quill/io/word.py`**

- `read_word_document(path, timeout_sec=60.0, fallback_to_plaintext=True) → Document`
  - Extracts text from .docx or .doc file
  - Returns `Document` with extracted text, metadata, quality_score, and warnings
  - Timeout protection: max 60 seconds to prevent runaway conversions
  - Error cascade on failure: Pandoc → python-docx → plaintext fallback
  - Raises `UnsupportedFormatError` or `ExtractionTimeoutError` on fatal errors

- `write_word_document_safe(document, path=None, format="docx", warn_on_formatting_loss=True) → Path`
  - Safely writes extracted text back to Word format
  - Shows warning dialog: "Saving as plain text. Original Word formatting will be lost."
  - Uses Pandoc (Markdown → .docx) for clean roundtrip
  - Never overwrites original without explicit user confirmation

- `convert_word_to_markdown(path) → str`
  - Converts Word document to GitHub-flavored Markdown
  - Uses Pandoc with specific output flags for best compatibility

**Enhanced module: `quill/io/pandoc.py`**

Add Word-specific conversion routes:

```python
READER_MAP: dict[str, str] = {
    "docx": "docx",  # NEW: from .docx
    "doc": "doc",  # NEW: from .doc (legacy)
}

WRITER_MAP: dict[str, str] = {
    "word": "docx",  # NEW: export to .docx
    "word-old": "doc",  # NEW: export to .doc (legacy)
}


@dataclass(frozen=True, slots=True)
class WordMetadata:
    title: str | None
    author: str | None
    subject: str | None
    created: str | None
    modified: str | None
    word_count: int
    page_count: int
```

**Updated module: `quill/io/detect.py`**

```python
TEXT_EXTENSIONS = {
    # ... existing ...
    ".docx",  # NEW
    ".doc",  # NEW
}


def looks_like_word_document(path: Path) -> bool:
    return path.suffix.lower() in {".docx", ".doc"}
```

#### 5.3b.5 Error Handling: Graceful Cascade

Word extraction implements a three-tier fallback strategy to ensure the app never crashes on corrupted, malicious, or malformed files:

**Tier 1: Pandoc (primary path)**

- Subprocess-isolated extraction via Pandoc 3.1+
- Timeout: 60 seconds (hard limit)
- Success: `quality_score ≥ 60`
- On failure → Tier 2

**Tier 2: python-docx (fallback)**

- Basic paragraph/heading extraction only
- No Pandoc dependency required
- `quality_score ~40` (limited feature set)
- Errors logged; user sees warning banner
- On failure → Tier 3

**Tier 3: Emergency UTF-8 read**

- Last-resort: read file as text
- Returns garbled but won't crash
- `quality_score 0`
- Clear error message: "Document could not be fully read. Try opening in Microsoft Word first."

#### 5.3b.6 User-Facing Messaging (Document Intake Report)

When opening a .docx or .doc file, Quill displays an in-app banner (stored in `source_metadata`, displayed by `main_frame.py`):

```text
📄 Word Document Opened
This document has been converted to plain text for editing in Quill.
• Formatting (fonts, colors, styles) has been removed.
• Tables and lists have been simplified for readability.
• Images and charts have been replaced with captions only.
• If you need the original formatting, open this file in Microsoft Word.

Original file: Z:\documents\report.docx
Engine: Pandoc 3.1.0 | Quality score: 85/100

[🔄 Retry extraction]  [💾 Save as .txt]  [📖 Show details]
```

The banner is concise and accessible: each item is announced separately via screen reader, and action buttons are navigable via Tab.

**Where Am I enhancement:** When cursor is at the start of an extracted Word document, `Ctrl+Alt+W` (Where Am I) announces:
> "Word document. Title: Q2 Report. Author: Jane Doe. 8 pages, 2,451 words. Extracted by Pandoc 3.1.0. Quality: 85 out of 100. Formatting not preserved."

#### 5.3b.7 Pandoc Integration and Format Bridge

Pandoc is a universal document converter supporting 30+ input and output formats. Full integration enables:

**Phase 1 (v1.0 — this release):**

- Pandoc reads .docx and .doc files
- Export to Markdown, HTML, RTF via `File > Save As`
- Metadata extraction for document properties
- Fallback pipeline: Pandoc → python-docx → plaintext

**Phase 2 (v1.1):**

- Pandoc template engine for styled exports
- Batch conversion: `Tools > Convert Document`
- Support for .odt (LibreOffice), .tex (LaTeX)
- Optional: OCR images in Word documents (cloud service or local Tesseract)

**Phase 3 (v1.2+):**

- Pandoc filters for custom transformations
- Plugin API for format extension

**Installation and resource limits:**

- Pandoc is bundled with Quill on Windows (or installed via `choco install pandoc`)
- Subprocess isolation: Pandoc runs out-of-process; malicious code cannot harm Quill
- **Timeout**: 60 seconds per document (hard limit)
- **Memory**: Monitored via `psutil`; warns if > 500 MB used during extraction
- **File size**: Pre-check before extraction; if > 100 MB, warn and offer async extraction

#### 5.3b.8 Editable Rendering, Protected Original

Word files follow Quill's principle: **originals are read-only by default**.

- The extracted text is presented in the standard multi-line editor
- `Ctrl+S` opens **Save As** so the original `.docx` / `.doc` cannot be overwritten
- `Ctrl+Shift+S` opens Save As directly
- Save dialog offers: `.txt`, `.md` (Markdown), `.html`, `.docx` (new Word), or All Files
- Before saving to `.docx`, a warning dialog appears:
  > "Saving as plain text. Original Word formatting will be lost. Continue?"

#### 5.3b.9 Metadata and Quality Scoring

Extracted metadata is stored in the `Document.source_metadata` dict:

```python
source_metadata = {
    "source_kind": "word",
    "format": "docx",  # or "doc"
    "engine": "pandoc",
    "engine_version": "3.1.0",
    "quality_score": 85,  # 0–100
    "extraction_warnings": [
        "Images not extracted (captions only)",
        "Tracked changes simplified to plain text",
        "Columns flattened to single column",
    ],
    "word_metadata": {
        "title": "Q2 Report",
        "author": "Jane Doe",
        "subject": "Financial Review",
        "created": "2026-03-15T10:30:00Z",
        "modified": "2026-05-28T14:22:00Z",
        "word_count": 2451,
        "page_count": 8,
    },
}
```

**Quality score calculation (0–100):**

- Start at 100
- Subtract 5 per non-extracted image
- Subtract 10 per text box with suspected out-of-order content
- Subtract 15 if complex shapes or columns detected
- Subtract 20 if corrupted sections skipped
- Floor at 0, never negative

#### 5.3b.10 Risk Mitigation and Safety

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Large .docx files (10+ MB) cause extraction to hang | Application freeze, loss of edits to other docs | 60-second Pandoc timeout, async extraction option for large files |
| Corrupted Word files crash parser | Application crash | Graceful error cascade: Pandoc → python-docx → plaintext; never crash |
| Complex formatting confuses extraction order | User sees garbled text | Clear in-app banner: "Word formatting not preserved" + retry option |
| VBA macros or malicious code in .docx | Security vulnerability | Pandoc subprocess isolation; no code execution; explicit security testing |
| .doc (OLE) files fail silently | Silent data loss | Pandoc attempts .doc → XML; if it fails, fallback to python-docx |
| User saves edits back to .docx, loses formatting | Data loss if user relies on styles | Always prompt before save: "Saving as plain text. Continue?" + option to cancel |
| Memory explosion from embedded media | Out-of-memory crash | Pre-check file size; if > 50 MB, warn; if > 100 MB, offer async extraction |

#### 5.3b.10a Extraction Quality Diagnostics (Inspired by GLOW)

GLOW's document auditor and fixer provide patterns for deeply analyzing Word documents. Quill adopts similar diagnostic techniques to produce actionable extraction warnings:

**Paragraph-level diagnostics:**

- **Fake lists detection**: Scan paragraphs for manually typed bullet characters (•, ‣, ◯, ◯, ◦, ⁃) or numbered patterns ("1.", "a)") instead of built-in list styles; flag as "Potential fake list" in `source_metadata`
- **All-caps content**: Detect paragraphs in ALL CAPS (not formatting, but typed caps); if > 3 words, flag as potential heading that should be restyles
- **Long sections without headings**: If > 20 paragraphs appear without a heading, flag as "Consider adding structure" in extraction warnings
- **Repeated spaces for layout**: Detect runs of 3+ consecutive spaces used for visual alignment (e.g., `Qty: ___Price:___`); flag as "Document uses spaces for layout, which may reflow unexpectedly in Quill"
- **Repeated font families in paragraph**: Track non-Arial fonts per paragraph; cap reporting at 3 example locations + summary count to avoid spam

**Document-level diagnostics:**

- **Title and language metadata**: Extract document properties (title, language, author); if missing, flag "Document title not set in properties" as info-level warning
- **Page setup**: Extract margin configuration; compare against expected values; if margins are unusual (< 0.5" or > 1.5"), note in warnings
- **Hyphenation**: Detect if auto-hyphenation is enabled; flag as "Hyphenation may break words unexpectedly when text reflows"
- **Heading hierarchy**: Scan for missing levels (e.g., H1 followed by H3) or skipped levels; flag as structural issue

**Extraction engine diagnostics:**

- **Track extraction path**: Note which engine extracted each paragraph (Pandoc, python-docx, plaintext)
- **Per-paragraph confidence**: If Pandoc succeeded but python-docx fallback was triggered for some content, track which paragraphs used fallback
- **Engine switch detection**: If Pandoc extracted pages 1–8 but python-docx took pages 9–12, surface this as "Extraction method changed mid-document" warning

**Example source_metadata structure with GLOW-inspired diagnostics:**

```python
source_metadata = {
    "source_kind": "word",
    "format": "docx",
    "engine": "pandoc",
    "engine_version": "3.1.0",
    "quality_score": 78,  # Reduced from 85 due to diagnostics
    # GLOW-inspired diagnostics

        "fake_lists_detected": 2,  # Manually typed bullets
        "all_caps_paragraphs": 1,  # Heading-like caps text
        "long_sections_without_headings": ["Pages 5-6 (23 paragraphs)"],
        "repeated_space_paragraphs": 3,  # Layout abuse detected
        "non_arial_fonts": {"Times New Roman": 5, "Courier": 2},
        "hyphenation_enabled": True,
        "heading_hierarchy_issues": ["H1 at page 1, then H3 at page 2"],
        "extraction_engine_switches": ["Pandoc pages 1-8, python-docx pages 9-10"],

            "user_action": "review",
            "suggestion": "Consider reformatting as proper lists in Word",
        },

        },
    ],
    "word_metadata": {
        "title": "Q2 Report",
        "author": "Jane Doe",
        "subject": "Financial Review",

            "right_in": 1.0,
        },
    },
}
```

**User experience enhancement:**

Instead of a flat banner, Quill displays diagnostics with context:

```text
📄 Word Document Opened
Extracted via Pandoc 3.1.0 | Quality: 78/100 (down from 85 due to structural issues)

✓ 8 pages extracted, 2,451 words
✓ 12 headings (H1-H3) converted
⚠ 2 paragraphs with typed bullet characters (should be proper lists)
⚠ Long section without headings (23 paragraphs on pages 5-6)
⚠ Hyphenation enabled (may cause unexpected line breaks)
ℹ Document title: "Q2 Report" | Language: en-US

[🔍 View diagnostics] [💾 Save as .txt] [Learn more]
```

Clicking `[🔍 View diagnostics]` opens a detailed panel showing each diagnostic with suggestions and locations.

#### 5.3b.11 Testing Strategy

**Test corpus (stored in `tests/fixtures/word/`):**

| Document | Scenario |

**Unit tests (`tests/unit/io/test_word.py`):**

```python
def test_read_docx_simple():
    doc = read_word_document(Path("tests/fixtures/word/simple_heading.docx"))
    assert "Heading" in doc.text
    assert doc.source_metadata["quality_score"] > 80


def test_read_doc_legacy_format():
    doc = read_word_document(Path("tests/fixtures/word/legacy_format.doc"))
    assert doc.text.strip()  # Non-empty
    assert "engine" in doc.source_metadata


def test_read_corrupted_falls_back():
    doc = read_word_document(Path("tests/fixtures/word/corrupted.docx"))
    assert doc.source_metadata.get("quality_score", 0) < 50
    assert len(doc.text) > 0  # No crash; degraded gracefully


def test_read_timeout_protection():
    with pytest.raises(ExtractionTimeoutError):
        read_word_document(
            Path("tests/fixtures/word/large_50mb.docx"),
            timeout_sec=0.1,
        )


def test_macros_not_executed():
    doc = read_word_document(Path("tests/fixtures/word/malicious_macros.docx"))
    assert "VBA" not in doc.text and "Sub " not in doc.text
```

**Integration tests (`tests/integration/test_word_open.py`):**

- Open .docx via UI; verify text loads, no crash
- Check source_metadata banner appears
- Verify status bar shows correct word count, page count
- Save extracted text back to .docx; verify roundtrip produces sensible output
- Verify warning dialog appears before save

**Accessibility tests (`tests/a11y/test_word_screen_reader.py`):**

- NVDA/JAWS reading of extracted text
- Verify metadata banner is announced properly
- Keyboard-only workflow: open → read → navigate → save

**Performance tests (`tests/perf/test_word_extraction_speed.py`):**

- Load 5, 50, 500-page documents; measure extraction time and memory
- Confirm 60-second timeout stops runaway conversions
- Verify UI remains responsive during extraction

#### 5.3b.12 Rollout and Communication

Word documents should open through a direct/native Word-document path by default when the local engine can handle them. If that path is unavailable or fails on a particular file, Quill should offer an explicit choice to fall back to extracted-text import so the user always knows which mode they are entering.

**Pre-release (release notes):**

- Announce: "New: Microsoft Word support (v1.0)"
- Link to knowledge base: "Opening Word Documents in Quill"
- Highlight limitations: "Formatting is not preserved; use Save As for best results"

**In-app messaging (on first Word document open):**

- Display metadata banner with quality score
- Offer `[📖 Learn more]`, `[💾 Save as .txt]`, `[📝 Open as extracted text]`, `[❌ Close]` actions when the direct/native path is not available
- Help menu entry: "Opening Word Documents in Quill"

**Documentation:**

- **README**: "Supported Formats" section lists .docx/.doc with caveats
- **Knowledge base**: Step-by-step guide for opening, extracting, saving Word documents
- **Command palette**: "Open Word Document" command has full description
- **FAQ**: Proactive entries for "What happens to my formatting?" and "Can I edit the original Word file?"

#### 5.3b.13 Success Criteria

By end of v1.0:

1. ✅ **Functional**: Users open .docx/.doc through a direct/native Word path when available; extracted text remains readable/navigable with screen readers as a fallback, content (headings, lists, tables, links) preserved accurately, save to .txt/Markdown/new .docx
2. ✅ **Safe**: No crashes on corrupted/malicious/large files, VBA not executed, timeout prevents runaway conversions, user warned before formatting loss
3. ✅ **Discoverable**: File > Open shows .docx/.doc as supported, File > Save As offers Word formats, in-app banner explains changes, help docs explain workflow
4. ✅ **Tested**: 10+ real-world documents tested, unit/integration/a11y/perf tests passing, no regressions in existing formats
5. ✅ **Documented**: User docs explain what is and is not supported, known limitations transparent, troubleshooting guide provided

#### 5.3b.14 Future Enhancements (Post-v1.0)

- **Async extraction**: Large files extract in background without blocking UI
- **OCR images**: Option to OCR images in Word documents (local Tesseract or cloud service)
- **Format bridge UI**: Visual flow chart of all supported conversions (Word native/direct ↔ Markdown ↔ HTML ↔ PDF)
- **Batch conversion**: "Convert 50 Word docs to Markdown" automation
- **Metadata editor**: Simple UI to edit document title, author, creation date
- **Plugin API**: Allow plugins to register custom Word extraction filters
- **Roundtrip fidelity**: Preserve more metadata on Word → edit → Word cycles
- **Document audit mode (v1.1+)**: Scan incoming Word docs for structural issues (fake lists, poor heading hierarchy, orphaned paragraphs) and warn user
- **MarkItDown fallback**: If available, use Microsoft's MarkItDown for improved .doc and .docx extraction before Pandoc
- **VML namespace awareness**: Enhanced python-docx fallback with VML shape and text-box extraction for legacy .doc files
- **Paragraph-level diagnostics**: Track which extraction engine handled each paragraph, surface problematic content for review
- **Styled template export**: When saving as .docx, offer ACB-style or custom templates for accessibility compliance

### 5.3c Microsoft PowerPoint document support (PPTX / PPT)

This section is the canonical specification for PowerPoint support in Quill 1.0. Anything not listed is explicitly out of scope for v1.0 and tracked in the backlog.

#### 5.3c.1 Complexity and Risk Context

PowerPoint presentations (.pptx = XML-based, .ppt = binary OLE2 format) present unique extraction challenges:

1. **Non-linear content**: Slides arranged by visual layout, not reading order; multiple shapes per slide
2. **Visual-first design**: Slide transitions, animations, speaker notes separate from visible content
3. **Nested structure**: Master slides, slide layouts, themes, custom templates, shapes groups
4. **Embedded media**: Images, charts, SmartArt, embedded audio/video, links
5. **Layout complexity**: Text boxes, shapes, grouped objects with reading-order dependencies
6. **Presenter-specific data**: Speaker notes, slide timings, presentation settings
7. **Legacy cruft**: .ppt binary format, corrupted presentations, mixed encoding, malformed XML

Quill prioritizes **linear text extraction and speaker notes over slide visual preservation**. The design principle ("The edit field is sacred") prevents visual formatting preservation in v1.0.

#### 5.3c.2 Supported Features (What Gets Extracted)

**Read (Pandoc extraction):**

- ✅ Slide titles
- ✅ Body text and bullet points (nested up to 3 levels)
- ✅ Text from text boxes (best-effort reading order)
- ✅ Speaker notes (always extracted, separately indexed)
- ✅ Hyperlinks → preserved as plain-text URLs or Markdown links
- ✅ Slide numbers and slide count
- ✅ Presentation metadata: title, author, subject, creation date
- ✅ Basic slide structure: explicit slide markers for boundary detection
- ✅ Chart and SmartArt labels (text-only; visual data is lost)

**Conversion support (via Pandoc bridge):**

- ✅ PowerPoint → Markdown (slide-by-slide structure)
- ✅ PowerPoint → HTML (presentation as linear HTML document)
- ✅ PowerPoint → Plain text

**Metadata:**

- ✅ Presentation title, author, subject, keywords
- ✅ Creation/modification dates
- ✅ Slide count, speaker notes count
- ✅ Character encoding detection and preservation

#### 5.3c.3 Unsupported Features (Not Extracted, Logged, User Warned)

**Visual design (intentionally dropped for v1.0 compatibility):**

- ❌ Slide backgrounds, themes, custom templates
- ❌ Font names, sizes, colors, bold/italic/underline
- ❌ Slide transitions and animations (detected but not played)
- ❌ Master slides and slide layouts (flattened to content only)
- ❌ Alignment, positioning, spacing of text boxes
- ❌ Watermarks, headers, footers

**Advanced structures (extracted with limitations or skipped):**

- ⚠️ **Images and pictures**: Filenames and captions only; image content is NOT OCR'd unless user opts in v1.1+
- ⚠️ **Charts**: Extracted as text labels only; visual data is lost; title and data labels if readable
- ⚠️ **SmartArt**: Converted to bullet-point approximation; visual hierarchy is lost
- ⚠️ **Embedded video/audio**: NOT extracted; presence flagged with duration if available
- ⚠️ **Text boxes and shapes**: Attempted extraction; may appear out of slide reading order
- ⚠️ **Slide layouts and masters**: Flattened to content only; layout structure is not preserved
- ⚠️ **Animations and timing**: Detected and reported but not executed; all animated content extracted

**Security-sensitive (explicitly blocked or sanitized):**

- ❌ Embedded ActiveX controls or macros (VBA) — silently ignored; Pandoc does not execute
- ❌ External links to remote templates or resources (not followed)
- ❌ OLE embedded objects

**Deferred to v1.1+ (not attempted in v1.0):**

- ❌ Presentation handout mode or notes pages export
- ❌ Custom animations or presentation sequences (click-through, auto-play)
- ❌ Form controls or interactive content
- ❌ Presenter view or presenter notes as a separate stream

#### 5.3c.4 Slide Linearization with Reading-Order Detection (GLOW-Inspired)

PowerPoint is inherently non-linear. Quill converts to linear text with intelligent reading-order analysis inspired by GLOW's accessibility auditor:

GLOW discovered that screen readers follow the XML tree order of shapes, not the visual layout. When these don't match, screen readers read slides in the wrong order. Quill analyzes both orders and extracts in visual order (what user sees) while flagging reading-order mismatches to the user.

**Output: Intelligent slide extraction with reading-order diagnostics**

```text
--- Slide 2: Agenda ---
[Title appears first - reading order verified]
Agenda

[3 text boxes detected on slide; visual order verified]
Left column (top-left position):
  • Introduction
    • Background
    • Scope

Right column (top-right position):
  • Main topics
    • Topic 1
    • Topic 2

Center callout (center position):
  🔹 All topics are in scope

📊 Reading Order Analysis:
  ✓ Visual order matches XML order (correct for screen readers)
  ✓ Title reads first (best practice)
  Shapes in reading order: Title → Left → Right → Center
```

#### 5.3c.5 Smart Speaker Notes Extraction (GLOW-Inspired)

Speaker notes are **always extracted and separately indexed** with intelligent metadata:

- Presence detection: slide has/lacks notes
- Timing hints: notes mentioning "2 minutes", "pause here", "auto-advance"
- Visual references: notes mentioning images, charts, diagrams on the slide
- Presenter guidance: transitions, animation, pacing guidance

Example metadata:

```python
{
    "slide": 5,
    "slide_title": "Results",
    "notes": "Reference the chart. This slide auto-advances in 5 seconds.",
    "notes_has_timing": True,
    "notes_mentions_visuals": True,
    "notes_word_count": 18,
}
```

**Magical UI integration:** When user navigates to a slide with speaker notes, Quill announces:

> "Slide 5 of 15: Results. Speaker notes mention slide visuals and timing. Notes say: 'Reference the chart. This slide auto-advances in 5 seconds.'"

#### 5.3c.6 Animations and Timing Detection with WCAG Analysis (GLOW-Inspired)

Animations are **detected, categorized, and intelligently reported** using GLOW's WCAG timing analysis:

- Slide-level auto-advance timing (WCAG 2.2.1): < 3 seconds flagged as violation
- Shape-level animations: entrance, exit, click-triggered animations categorized
- Animation impact: content appearing on click is flagged as potentially hidden

Example output:

```text
⏱ Animation Timing Analysis:
  • Title: "Fade in" (0.5s, starts with slide)
  • Content: "Fly in" (1.0s, appears on click)

🎯 Accessibility Notes:
  → Title auto-animates, so screen reader reads immediately
  → Content requires manual click to reveal
  → Quill has extracted ALL text; no content lost
  ⚠ Warning: Slide 3 auto-advances in 2.5s (< 3s WCAG recommendation)
```

#### 5.3c.7 Slide Title Analysis (GLOW-Inspired)

GLOW discovered that duplicate or missing slide titles break outline navigation. Quill analyzes titles:

- Missing titles: slide has no title shape
- Duplicate titles: same title on multiple slides
- Weak titles: titles that don't describe slide content

Example diagnostics:

```python
"extraction_diagnostics": {
    "slide_titles": [
        {"slide": 1, "title": "Title Slide", "issue": None},
        {"slide": 5, "title": "[No title]", "issue": "missing"},
        {"slide": 6, "title": "Agenda", "issue": "duplicate", "also_on_slides": [2]},
    ],
}
```

#### 5.3c.8 Link and Alt-Text Quality Analysis (GLOW-Inspired)

GLOW discovered accessibility patterns in hyperlinks and alt text. Quill checks for:

- **Bad link text**: "click here", "here", "link", "more"
- **Bare URLs**: raw URLs used as link text instead of descriptive text
- **Missing alt text**: images and charts without descriptions
- **Filename alt text**: alt text that's just the image filename (unhelpful)

#### 5.3c.9 Chart and Visual Content Analysis (GLOW-Inspired)

Quill detects charts, SmartArt, and images. For charts:

- Extracts chart type (column, line, pie, etc.)
- Extracts chart title and axis labels from XML
- Checks for alt text describing the chart
- Attempts to infer data values from label positions (with caution warnings)

#### 5.3c.10 Extraction Quality Diagnostics (GLOW-Inspired Comprehensive Scoring)

Instead of simple text-density scoring, Quill implements **findings-based quality scoring** modeled after GLOW's audit approach:

**Quality scoring system:**

- Baseline: 100 points
- Per-finding penalties (e.g., missing alt text: -5, auto-advance < 3s: -8, duplicate title: -3)
- Bonuses for best practices (speaker notes on >80% of slides: +2, correct reading order: +1)

Example breakdown:

```text
Quality Score: 78/100

Baseline:                                          100
-5 (Images without alt text)                        -5
-5 (Chart without alt text)                         -5
-8 (Slide 3: Auto-advance 2.5s < 3s WCAG)          -8
-3 (Duplicate title)                                -3
+1 (Reading order verified)                         +1
___________________________________________
Quality:                                            78
```

**In-app quality dashboard:**

```text
📊 PowerPoint Presentation Opened
Quality Score: 78/100

Extraction Summary:
  • 15 slides extracted
  • 12 slides have speaker notes
  • 5 animations detected
  • 8 images (5 with alt text, 3 missing)
  • 3 charts (1 with alt text, 2 missing)

⚠ Issues Found (3):
  1. Slide 3: Auto-advance too fast (2.5s < 3s) - WCAG 2.2.1
  2. Slides 2, 6: Duplicate title "Agenda"
  3. 3 images without alt text

✓ All text extracted successfully (no content lost)
```

#### 5.3c.11 User-Facing Messaging

When opening a .pptx or .ppt file, Quill displays:

```text
📊 PowerPoint Presentation Opened
This presentation has been converted to plain text for editing in Quill.
• Slide structure, formatting, and animations are not preserved.
• Text boxes and shapes have been simplified to plain text.
• Images, charts, and embedded media have been replaced with captions only.
• Speaker notes are available (12 slides have notes).
• If you need the original presentation, open this file in PowerPoint.

Original file: Z:\documents\Q2-review.pptx
Engine: Pandoc 3.1.0 | Slides: 15 | Quality score: 82/100

[📖 View notes]  [💾 Save as .txt]  [📖 Learn more]
```

**Where Am I enhancement:** When cursor is at document start, `Ctrl+Alt+W` announces:

> "PowerPoint presentation. Title: Q2 Review. 15 slides, 5,847 words. Speaker notes on 12 slides. Extracted by Pandoc 3.1.0. Quality: 82 out of 100."

#### 5.3c.12 Editable Rendering, Protected Original

Presentations follow Quill's principle: **originals are read-only by default**.

- Extracted text is presented in the standard editor
- `Ctrl+S` opens **Save As** so original `.pptx` cannot be overwritten
- Save dialog offers: `.txt`, `.md` (Markdown), `.html`, new `.pptx`, or All Files
- Before saving to `.pptx`, warning appears: "Saving as plain text. Original slide structure will be lost. Continue?"

#### 5.3c.13 Metadata and Extraction Diagnostics

Extracted metadata stored in `Document.source_metadata`:

```python
source_metadata = {
    "source_kind": "powerpoint",
    "format": "pptx",  # or "ppt"
    "engine": "pandoc",
    "quality_score": 82,  # 0–100 (findings-based)
    "powerpoint_metadata": {
        "title": "Q2 Review",
        "author": "Jane Doe",
        "subject": "Quarterly Business Review",
        "created": "2026-02-15T10:30:00Z",

            {"type": "duplicate_title", "slides": [2, 6], "title": "Agenda"},
        ],
    },
}
```

#### 5.3c.14 Testing Strategy

**Test corpus (stored in `tests/fixtures/powerpoint/`):**

| Document | Scenario |
|----------|----------|
| `simple_title_slide.pptx` | Single slide with title and bullet points |
| `multi_slide_structured.pptx` | 10 slides with titles, nested bullets, speaker notes |
| `with_charts.pptx` | 5 slides with embedded charts; extract labels only |
| `with_images.pptx` | 3 slides with images and captions |
| `with_animations.pptx` | Slides with animations and transitions; verify all text extracted |
| `legacy_format.ppt` | MS PowerPoint 97–2003 format; verify .ppt reader works |
| `corrupted.pptx` | Intentionally malformed XML; verify graceful fallback |
| `large_100_slides.pptx` | Large presentation; verify timeout protection |

**Unit tests (`tests/unit/io/test_powerpoint.py`):**

```python
def test_read_pptx_simple():
    doc = read_powerpoint_presentation(Path("tests/fixtures/powerpoint/simple_title_slide.pptx"))
    assert "Slide 1" in doc.text
    assert doc.source_metadata["quality_score"] > 80


def test_speaker_notes_extracted():
    doc = read_powerpoint_presentation(Path("tests/fixtures/powerpoint/with_speaker_notes.pptx"))
    assert len(doc.source_metadata["speaker_notes"]) > 0


def test_animations_detected():
    doc = read_powerpoint_presentation(Path("tests/fixtures/powerpoint/with_animations.pptx"))
    assert doc.source_metadata["extraction_diagnostics"]["animations_detected"] > 0
```

#### 5.3c.15 Safety and Security

- ✅ **Sandbox execution**: Pandoc runs in subprocess
- ✅ **Resource limits**: Timeout (60s), memory monitoring
- ✅ **No code execution**: VBA macros NOT executed
- ✅ **Fallback chain**: Pandoc → python-pptx → plaintext
- ✅ **User consent**: Warning before overwriting original

#### 5.3c.16 Success Criteria

1. ✅ **Functional**: Users open .pptx/.ppt, extract text readable with screen readers, speaker notes accessible
2. ✅ **Safe**: No crashes on corrupted/malicious files, VBA not executed, user warned before data loss
3. ✅ **Discoverable**: File > Open shows .pptx/.ppt as supported, in-app banner explains changes
4. ✅ **Tested**: 10+ real presentations tested, unit/integration/a11y tests passing
5. ✅ **Documented**: User docs explain what is and is not supported

#### 5.3c.17 Future Enhancements (Post-v1.0)

- **Async extraction**: Large presentations extract in background without blocking UI
- **OCR images**: Option to OCR images in presentations (local Tesseract or cloud service)
- **Handout export**: Linearized slides + speaker notes as single document
- **Presentation outline navigator**: Slide titles as expandable tree with speaker notes
- **Batch conversion**: "Convert 10 presentations to Markdown"
- **Plugin API**: Allow plugins to register custom presentation extraction filters
- **MarkItDown fallback**: Use Microsoft's MarkItDown for improved extraction before Pandoc
- **Chart extraction**: Better chart data extraction (tables from visual charts via OCR)

### 5.4 Excel and CSV support (XLSX / XLS / CSV)

This section specifies Quill's support for tabular data formats: Excel workbooks (.xlsx, .xls) and CSV files (.csv, .tsv). The design prioritizes **accessible grid-based editing mode** as an alternative to traditional spreadsheet UIs, with keyboard-first navigation and GLOW-inspired data quality analysis.

#### 5.4.1 Design Philosophy: Accessible Grid, Not Spreadsheet

Traditional spreadsheets (Excel, LibreOffice Calc) are visual-first and mouse-oriented. Quill reimagines grid editing for keyboard and screen-reader users:

- **Linear keyboard navigation**: Arrow keys move through cells top-to-bottom, left-to-right
- **F2 cell editing**: Edit mode restricted to cell content only; cursor never leaves the cell
- **Status bar context**: "Row 5, Column C (Sales): $75,000" announced before user types
- **Accessible sorting/filtering**: Shift+F10 or right-click to sort columns ascending/descending, filter by value
- **No visual formatting preserved**: Bold, colors, borders intentionally dropped (edit field is sacred)
- **All transformations in plain-text mode**: Pivot tables, transpose, statistics available without leaving CSV Mode

#### 5.4.2 Scope: CSV Mode as Universal Tabular Editor

**CSV files (native support):**

- Open directly in CSV Mode
- Auto-detect delimiters (comma, semicolon, tab, pipe)
- Auto-detect column types (text, integer, float, date, currency, boolean)
- User can toggle first row as column headers
- Full grid editing capabilities (add/delete rows/columns, sort, filter)
- Save back to CSV (or export to Excel, TSV, JSON, SQL, HTML, Markdown)

**Excel files (.xlsx / .xls) - via MarkItDown bridge:**

- Detect format on open
- Auto-convert to CSV using MarkItDown (primary) or openpyxl (fallback)
- Multi-sheet support: user prompted to load sheet, combine all, or create separate documents
- All CSV Mode features work on converted Excel data
- Save options: back to CSV, new Excel file, or export to original Excel format
- Legacy .xls (binary) support via openpyxl fallback

**Why CSV as universal format:**

- Plain-text, version-control friendly, universally accessible
- No hidden metadata, macro viruses, or formatting complexity
- MarkItDown converts any table → CSV automatically
- Screen-reader friendly; structure is explicit (headers, rows, columns)
- Easy to validate, transform, and audit

#### 5.4.3 CSV Mode UI and Keyboard Shortcuts

**Status bar in CSV Mode shows:**

```text
📊 CSV Mode (15 rows × 4 columns) | Headers: ✓ | Delimiter: Comma
```

**Navigation (arrow keys):**

- Arrow keys: Move to adjacent cell (up/down/left/right)
- Ctrl+Home: Go to cell A1 (first cell)
- Ctrl+End: Go to last cell with data
- Ctrl+Right/Left: Jump to next/previous non-empty cell in row
- Ctrl+Down/Up: Jump to next/previous non-empty cell in column
- Page Up / Page Down: Move up/down by 10 rows

**Cell editing (F2 mode):**

- Press F2 to enter edit mode for current cell
- Cursor restricted to cell content only; cannot move to adjacent cells
- Backspace/Delete/Ctrl+A work as expected within the cell
- Escape cancels edit without saving
- Enter commits and moves to next row
- Shift+Enter commits and moves to previous row

**Sorting and filtering (Shift+F10 / Right-click):**

- Shift+F10 or right-click to open column context menu
  - "Sort Ascending" (A→Z, 0→9, empty at bottom)
  - "Sort Descending" (Z→A, 9→0, empty at top)
  - "Move Column Left / Right"
  - "Delete Column / Insert Column"
  - "Filter by Value" (if headers present)
- Ctrl+Shift+L: Toggle filter row (when headers present)

**Selection (Shift+arrows):**

- Shift+Arrow keys: Extend selection to adjacent cells
- Shift+Spacebar: Select entire row
- Ctrl+A: Select all cells

#### 5.4.4 Transformational Features (GLOW-Inspired Data Analysis)

**Quick stats (Ctrl+Alt+S):**
When a numeric column is selected, Ctrl+Alt+S opens statistics panel showing Sum, Average, Median, Min, Max, Standard Deviation.

**Data validation and quality (Ctrl+Alt+V):**
GLOW-inspired findings-based approach: detect empty cells, duplicates, type mismatches, outliers, inconsistent formatting with quality score and auto-fix suggestions.

**Pivot table (Ctrl+Alt+P):**
Group by column with aggregation (Sum, Average, Count, Min, Max).

**Transpose (Ctrl+Alt+T):**
Flip rows and columns.

**Find and replace with regex (Ctrl+H):**
Full regex support with capture groups.

**Concatenate / Split columns (Ctrl+Alt+C / Ctrl+Alt+X):**
Combine or split columns by delimiter.

**Unique values (Ctrl+Alt+U):**
Extract distinct values and create new sheet or copy to clipboard.

**Conditional formatting as comments (Ctrl+Alt+F):**
Mark cells based on conditions (e.g., "Salary > $90,000" adds comment).

#### 5.4.5 Multi-Sheet Excel Support

When opening Excel files with multiple sheets, user is prompted to load sheet, combine all, or create separate documents. Sheet navigation via Ctrl+Page Down/Up.

#### 5.4.6 Format Detection (GLOW-Inspired Type Inference)

When opening CSV or Excel files, Quill auto-detects column types (Text, Integer, Float, Date, Boolean, Currency), date format, currency symbols, encoding, and delimiters with quality assessment.

#### 5.4.7 Save and Export Options

Users can save to CSV, TSV, Pipe-delimited, Excel (.xlsx), JSON, HTML table, Markdown table, or SQL INSERT statements with accessibility options (include column types, freeze headers, set widths).

#### 5.4.8 MarkItDown Integration for Universal Format Conversion

Quill uses Microsoft's MarkItDown library as a Tier 1 converter for Excel files, PDF tables, and web tables, converting all tabular formats to CSV for consistent editing.

#### 5.4.9 Data Quality and Accessibility Patterns (GLOW-Inspired)

Built-in audits for column type consistency, dataset completeness, duplicate detection, and outlier analysis with actionable suggestions.

#### 5.4.10 Testing Strategy

Comprehensive test corpus including simple CSV, headers, mixed types, large files (10k rows), special characters, sparse data, malformed CSV, multi-sheet Excel, formulas, and legacy .xls files. Unit, integration, a11y, and performance tests all included.

#### 5.4.11 Safety and Security

- ✅ **Formula injection prevention**: CSV exports escape Excel formula indicators
- ✅ **Encoding safety**: Detects and preserves UTF-8, UTF-16, ANSI
- ✅ **Macro safety**: Excel macros NOT extracted or executed
- ✅ **Large file handling**: Warn if CSV > 50MB; streaming mode available
- ✅ **Local-only processing**: No network access

#### 5.4.12 Success Criteria

1. ✅ **Functional**: Users open CSV/Excel in accessible CSV Mode; grid navigation, sorting, filtering, transformations work

### 5.5 PDF handling in v1.0

This section is the canonical, scoped statement of what Quill 1.0 does with PDF files. Anything not listed here is explicitly out of scope for v1.0 and tracked in the backlog ([section 17](#17-backlog-and-deferred-items)).

**What v1.0 ships**

1. **Tier 1, local extraction (automatic on open).** A layered pipeline runs `pdfplumber` and `pypdfium2` (with `pdfminer.six` as a third fallback) per page, scores each extraction for readability (line count, alphabetic ratio, average line length, presence of suspicious one-word-per-line patterns), and picks the best result per page. Pages are concatenated with explicit page markers so page navigation is exact.
2. **Page navigation.** `Page Up` / `Page Down` move to the previous/next page marker. `Ctrl+G` opens Go To Page when page markers exist. The status bar's Page cell shows `Page n of m`. Reaching the first or last page is announced.
3. **Embedded bookmarks.** Bookmarks (Adobe's outline) become Quill bookmarks for that document and appear in the Outline Navigator (5.16) under their original hierarchy. They are read-only with respect to the original PDF; renaming, adding, and deleting affect Quill's own bookmark store.
4. **Password-protected PDFs.** On open, Quill prompts for the password through a standard modal dialog. The password is used in-memory only and is never written to disk, never logged, never sent over the network.
5. **Editable rendering, protected original.** The extracted text is presented in the standard editor. `Ctrl+S` opens **Save As** so the original `.pdf` cannot be overwritten by extracted text. The Save dialog offers Text, Markdown, HTML, and All Files.
6. **Document metadata.** Author, title, subject, keywords, creation date, modification date, and page count are accessible via `File > Document Properties…` and announced in Where Am I when the document is a PDF.
7. **PDF document statistics.** Document Statistics (5.19) reports page count, image count per page (informational), tagged-structure presence, and language metadata.
8. **Accessibility audit, informational.** The Accessibility Audit (5.20) reports whether the PDF has tagged structure, whether it has embedded bookmarks, the image-only page count, language metadata, and password protection state. It does not modify the PDF.
9. **Tier 3, AI-assisted reading order (opt-in, manual).** `Tools > Improve Reading Order…` sends the PDF to the user-configured LLM provider (the user supplies the API key; nothing is bundled). The action **always** asks for confirmation before sending, shows the host name and approximate size in the confirmation dialog, announces progress every ~20 seconds during the request, and reports the outcome. Refuses, with a clear spoken message, if the PDF exceeds the configured page-count limit (default 40). Results open as a new unsaved document whose Save defaults to Save As.
10. **OCR for scanned PDFs.** When tier 1 yields no readable text on a page, Quill offers a one-click escalation to local OCR via the bundled Tesseract (English shipped, additional languages downloadable). For longer scanned PDFs the user may instead escalate to tier 3 AI rendering.
11. **Selection and copy.** Standard selection works in the extracted text. `Ctrl+C` copies as plain text. There is no copy-with-formatting target in v1.0 (the extracted text has none).
12. **Find, Outline, Bookmarks, Word Count, Document Statistics, Read Aloud, Accessibility Audit** all work over the extracted text exactly as they do for any other document.
13. **Compare** (`Tools > Compare With File…`) works against the extracted text representation; comparing two PDFs compares their extracted plain-text forms.

**What v1.0 does not ship (deferred to backlog)**

- **Tier 2 "enhanced local" extractor.** No pure-Python local layout analyser meets the v1.0 quality bar. v1.0 has tier 1 and tier 3 only.
- **Heading synthesis from font-size analysis** when no embedded bookmarks exist. Off by default; available as an opt-in experimental switch in Advanced settings, clearly labelled as experimental.
- **PDF form filling and signing.** Not in v1.0.
- **Writing back to PDF** (annotation, highlight, comment). Not in v1.0; original PDF is read-only by design.
- **Embedded media** (audio, video, 3D, attachments inside the PDF). Not in v1.0.
- **XFA forms.** Not in v1.0.
- **Tagged-structure tree editor.** Reading the structure summary is in; editing it is backlog.

### 5.6 Improve reading order

A general action under Tools and the command palette:

- For text-based documents, sends the current document text to the configured LLM for layout repair.
- For PDF and legacy DOC, sends the original file so text boxes and visual columns can be analysed.
- For PPTX, can send the file when local extraction is insufficient.
- Always asks first. Never used to answer questions about the document.
- Result opens as a new unsaved document; Save defaults to Save As.

### 5.7 HTML and Markdown

- HTML files open as plain text in the editor.
- `File > Preview as HTML` writes a temporary HTML file and opens the default browser.
- Markdown files open as plain text.
- `File > Preview Markdown as HTML` renders via `markdown-it-py` and opens the browser.
- `File > Export Markdown as HTML` saves a standalone HTML file.
- `File > Export Markdown as Word` produces a `.docx` via `python-docx`, preserving headings, lists, links, tables, code blocks.

### 5.8 Find and replace

Find in Quill is designed to feel like Microsoft editors and Visual Studio Code at the same time: F3 just works once a term is known, the search term is remembered everywhere it makes sense, and everything is announced.

**The search term, the central concept.** Quill maintains a single "current search term" per editor. The term is set by any of:

- typing in the Find dialog and pressing Enter,
- pressing `Ctrl+F3` with a selection (the selection becomes the search term),
- pressing `Ctrl+F3` with no selection (the word under the cursor becomes the search term),
- restoring it from session storage on launch (when enabled),
- arrow-selecting a previous term from the Find dialog's history dropdown.

The status bar's **Search term** cell (5.1b) displays the current search term and its options. `Enter` on the cell reopens Find pre-filled.

**Keystrokes**

- `Ctrl+F` opens Find. Pressing Enter searches forward, sets the search term, selects the match, and announces `Found on line 12: <line text>`.
- `Ctrl+Shift+F` opens Find anchored to backwards search.
- `F3` advances to the **next** occurrence of the current search term without opening any dialog. If no term is set, F3 opens Find with focus in the input. If a term is set, F3 simply selects the next match and announces line + context. At end of document, search wraps to the start (announced as "Wrapped to top").
- `Shift+F3` does the same in reverse, wrapping at the start to the end ("Wrapped to bottom").
- `Ctrl+F3` sets the current word or selection as the search term and advances. `Ctrl+Shift+F3` sets it and retreats. This is the Visual Studio convention.
- `Alt+F3` opens **Find All**: a list of every match with line number and context line, in a stock `wx.ListBox`. Enter jumps to a match; the dialog stays open so the user can iterate. The cell at the bottom shows `Match 3 of 17`.
- `Ctrl+H` opens Replace. Options: case sensitive, whole word, regex, **in selection** (pre-checked when a selection is present on open). Replace, Replace All, Find Next, Find Previous buttons. Replace All reports `Replaced 12 occurrences`. Undo is one step.
- `Esc` from any Find or Replace dialog closes it and returns focus to the editor at the previous cursor position (not at the last match unless the user pressed Enter).
- **"Not found"** is always spoken, never silent. After two consecutive not-found beeps, Quill suggests opening Find All to verify the term.

**History and persistence**

- Find and Replace remember the last 20 terms per session (in-memory) and the last 100 across sessions (on-disk, in `%APPDATA%\Quill\search-history.json`; cleared from a single button in Settings → Privacy). Replacement strings have their own parallel history.
- The dropdown arrow on the Find input opens history; Up/Down arrows in the input cycle through history when the input is empty.

**Incremental preview (opt-in, off by default)**

- A Settings switch `Editing → Incremental Find Preview` makes the editor preview the next match as the user types in the Find dialog (Notepad++ style). Escape returns the cursor to where it was before Find opened. Enter commits and closes. Off by default because preview-driven cursor movement can confuse screen readers; we expose it for users who prefer it.

**Predictable announcements**

- On every match Quill announces a structured one-liner: `Found on line N: <line text>`. The line text is truncated to 200 characters with an ellipsis to keep speech short. Long lines are abbreviated around the match so the matched text is always in the spoken slice.
- On wrap: `Wrapped to top` or `Wrapped to bottom`, followed by the match announcement.
- On Replace All: `Replaced N occurrences in document` or `Replaced N occurrences in selection`.
- On regex error: a single sentence, no traceback.

**Find in current selection.** When the editor has a non-empty selection at the moment Find or Replace is opened, the "In selection" checkbox is pre-checked; Replace All scopes its work to the selection. F3 and Shift+F3 continue to operate document-wide regardless, because muscle memory expects that.

**Find next while typing.** When the Find dialog is closed and the search term is set, typing in the editor does not interfere with F3; the search term is preserved until the user clears it (`Ctrl+Shift+\` or status-bar cell context menu → Clear Search).

**Project-wide Find (Find in Folder)** is deferred to v1.2.

### 5.9 Spell checking (magical, local-first)

This section was significantly expanded in v0.2 of this PRD. See [section 6](#6-spell-checking-deep-dive) for the full design and the decision rationale.

Quill ships **its own spell checking engine**, built on Hunspell dictionaries, designed from the ground up for screen-reader speed and predictability. It does **not** depend on TinySpell or any other external spell-checker process.

- `F7` opens the full Spell Check dialog (Word-style, but accessible).
- As-you-type checking is on by default. Misspellings are tracked in a sidecar model (not visual squiggles) and announced gently on word boundary if the user opts in.
- `Ctrl+;` jumps to the next misspelling and opens an inline suggestion popup (a small modal list, fully keyboard driven).
- Suggestions come from Hunspell plus an n-gram reranker trained on the user's writing for personalised top-3 suggestions.
- Personal dictionary persists per user; per-document dictionary persists in a sidecar file.
- Multiple simultaneous dictionaries: e.g. English (UK) plus a technical jargon list plus the document's own dictionary, merged with priority.
- All entirely local. No cloud round-trip ever for spell check.

### 5.10 Word count and navigation

- `Ctrl+Shift+W` reports words, characters, and paragraphs. Reports on selection if present.
- `Page Up` / `Page Down` navigate by real page markers (PDF). Announces page on move.
- `Ctrl+G` opens Go To Line, or Go To Page when page markers exist.

### 5.10 Bookmarks

- Bookmarks are **named jump points** intended for durable anchors a user wants to revisit by name.
- `Ctrl+B` sets a bookmark at the current position. Prompts for a name.
- Stored per bookmark: name, line number, column, ~120 characters of surrounding text, document path, ISO timestamp.
- `Ctrl+Shift+G` opens Bookmarks Manager.
- On jump: if the stored line still contains the surrounding text, go there. If not, search for the surrounding text and update the bookmark. If still not found, fall back to line number and announce "approximate position."
- Bookmarks for saved documents persist in `%APPDATA%\Quill\bookmarks\<hash>.json`.

### 5.11 Selection helpers and Where Am I

- `Ctrl+Shift+,` marks selection anchor; `Ctrl+Shift+.` extends selection.
- `Ctrl+Shift+I` Where Am I. In the editor: line, column, word count, modified state, page if available. In dialogs: structured description of the current field.

### 5.12 Command palette (Visual Studio Code style)

This is a centrepiece of v0.2. See [section 7](#7-command-palette-deep-dive) for the complete design.

- Single shortcut: `Ctrl+Shift+P` (also `F1`).
- Prefix-driven modes inside one input field, exactly like VS Code:
  - No prefix: command search.
  - `>` explicit command prefix (typing it is optional; a fresh palette starts in command mode).
  - `?` shows help for available prefixes.
  - `:` go to line.
  - `@` go to bookmark in current document.
  - `#` go to bookmark across all open documents.
  - `!` show warnings and errors (spell check issues, broken bookmarks, unsupported features used).
  - `<` open a recent file.
  - `~` switch open document.
  - `=` open a setting.
- Fuzzy matching with subsequence scoring, recency boost, and frequency boost (most-recently-used commands float to the top).
- Each row shows: command title, current keybinding, source (core or plugin), and a short hint.
- Right-arrow on a command edits its keybinding inline (see [section 8](#8-keymap-and-keystroke-reassignment)).
- Fully keyboard driven. Standard `wx.ListBox` underneath, with a `wx.SearchCtrl` on top. All accessible via stock screen-reader behaviour.

### 5.13 Document backups

- On every save of an existing file, the previous saved bytes are copied to `%APPDATA%\Quill\backups\<hash>\<iso-timestamp>.bak`.
- `File > Restore Document Backup` lists backups for the current document, newest first.
- Restore prompts for confirmation. Before overwriting the editor, the current buffer is backed up too.
- Restored text is marked modified; user saves with `Ctrl+S`.
- Retention: default keep last 50 per document, prune older than 90 days, never delete the most recent 5.
- Crash recovery: autosave snapshot every 30 seconds while a document is dirty; on launch, Quill offers to recover any orphan snapshots.

### 5.14 Settings

`Ctrl+,` opens Settings, organised in a `wx.Treebook`:

- **General**, **Editing**, **Reading**, **Spell check**, **PDF and AI**, **Files**, **Appearance**, **Backups**, **Keyboard** (see [section 8](#8-keymap-and-keystroke-reassignment)), **Privacy**.

### 5.15 Plugin system (v1.1)

- Plugins are Python packages discovered in `%APPDATA%\Quill\plugins`.
- Each plugin can register commands, file format readers and writers, settings pages, palette entries, and **default keybindings** (which the user can override).
- Plugin manifest must declare network and filesystem use.

### 5.16 Outline Navigator (heading tree)

One of Quill's signature productivity wins for readers and writers. Opens a tree of every heading in the current document, fully accessible, and lets the user jump anywhere in two keystrokes.

- `Ctrl+Shift+H` opens the Outline Navigator. The window contains a filter `wx.SearchCtrl`, a `wx.TreeCtrl` of headings, and standard OK/Cancel/Jump buttons. Everything stock; screen readers handle it natively.
- The outline is computed deterministically per format:
  - **Markdown**: ATX (`#`) and Setext (`===`, `---`) headings, parsed via `markdown-it-py` AST.
  - **HTML/XHTML/MHTML**: `<h1>`…`<h6>` and `<section><h*>` patterns via `beautifulsoup4`. ARIA `role="heading" aria-level="n"` is honoured.
  - **reStructuredText**: title underline conventions via `docutils`.
  - **AsciiDoc**: `=` through `======` lines.
  - **Org-mode**: `*` through `******` lines.
  - **LaTeX/Typst**: `\part`, `\chapter`, `\section`, `\subsection`, `\subsubsection`, `\paragraph`; Typst `= heading` syntax.
  - **DOCX**: paragraphs styled Heading 1–9 (via `python-docx`).
  - **EPUB**: `nav.xhtml` first, falling back to `toc.ncx`.
  - **PDF**: embedded document bookmarks (the same tree shown in Adobe Reader's bookmarks pane); also synthesised from font-size analysis when no bookmarks exist (opt-in, off by default).
  - **DAISY**: navigation document.
  - **Subtitle files**: chapter markers if present; otherwise time-bucketed sections every five minutes.
  - **Jupyter notebooks**: each Markdown heading inside Markdown cells, plus a synthetic node per cell.
  - **Generic fallback**: lines that look like headings (ALL CAPS short lines, numbered sections like `1.`, `1.1`) are offered as a flat list with a warning that the document has no real structure.
- Tree behaviour:
  - Up/Down arrow navigates between headings. Right Arrow expands; Left Arrow collapses. `*` (numpad or shift+8) expands all descendants of the focused node.
  - Typing in the filter field narrows the visible tree to headings whose text matches (substring, case-insensitive). The first match is announced. `Tab` returns focus to the tree.
  - `Enter` jumps the editor to the selected heading, closes the dialog, and announces `Jumped to heading level 2: <text>`.
  - `F2` renames the heading in place (editable formats only) and updates the document.
  - `Ctrl+C` copies the heading title; `Ctrl+Shift+C` copies the path (`Chapter 3 › Section 2 › Subsection 1`).
- The Outline Navigator also lives in the command palette under the `#` prefix when the current document has structure, so headings appear inline with document switching.
- Targets: build the tree for any text-based document up to 1 MB in under 50 ms; up to 10 MB in under 500 ms.

### 5.17 Jump-by-structure shortcuts

In-editor navigation by document structure, alongside the Outline dialog:

- `Ctrl+PgDn` / `Ctrl+PgUp`: next / previous heading of any level. Announces `Heading level 2: <text>`.
- `Ctrl+Alt+1` through `Ctrl+Alt+6`: next heading of level 1–6. `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+1–6` for previous.
- `Ctrl+Alt+0`: jump to the next paragraph that is not a heading (useful for skimming).
- `Ctrl+]` / `Ctrl+[`: next / previous block boundary (code fence, list, table, blockquote) in Markdown and HTML.
- `Ctrl+Alt+B`: jump to the start of the current logical block; `Ctrl+Alt+E` to the end.
- All shortcuts reassignable.

### 5.18 Line and block operations

VS Code-style editor productivity, all standard text-control operations:

- `Alt+Up` / `Alt+Down`: move the current line (or all selected lines) up or down. Announces the swap.
- `Ctrl+Shift+D`: duplicate the current line or selection.
- `Ctrl+Shift+K`: delete the entire current line.
- `Ctrl+L`: select the current line (repeat to extend by line).
- `Ctrl+J`: join the current and next line with a single space.
- `Tab` / `Shift+Tab` on a multi-line selection: indent or outdent.
- `Ctrl+/`: toggle line comment using the current document's comment marker (`#`, `//`, `<!-- -->`, etc.).
- `Ctrl+Shift+/`: toggle block comment where supported.
- **Tools menu**: Sort Selected Lines (ascending/descending, case-sensitive option, natural-numeric option), Remove Duplicate Lines, Reverse Lines, Trim Trailing Whitespace, Convert Indent (tabs↔spaces), Normalize Whitespace, Wrap to Column N.
- **Smart list continuation** (Markdown, opt-in): pressing Enter on a `-`, `*`, or `1.` line continues the list and increments numeric markers; pressing Enter on an empty list item ends the list.
- **Bracket and quote auto-pair** (off by default; per-format toggle in Settings). Never enabled in plain text.

### 5.19 Document statistics and reading metrics

Local, instant, never sends content anywhere.

- `Ctrl+Alt+S` opens the Document Statistics dialog.
- Reports: characters with and without spaces, words, sentences, paragraphs, lines, headings per level, links, images, code blocks, tables, footnotes.
- Estimated reading time at a configurable rate (default 200 wpm) and speaking time (default 150 wpm).
- Readability scores: Flesch Reading Ease, Flesch–Kincaid Grade Level, Gunning Fog, SMOG, Automated Readability Index. Each line in the dialog is a separate `wx.StaticText` so screen readers can read them one at a time.
- Longest sentence (with click-to-jump), average sentence length, longest paragraph.
- If a selection exists, statistics report on the selection and the title says so explicitly.
- Status bar shows running word count for the current document or selection.

### 5.20 Accessibility auditor

Quill's audience is exactly the audience that needs to _produce_ accessible documents. v1.0 ships a first-class auditor.

- `Ctrl+Alt+A` runs an Accessibility Audit on the current document and opens the Issues dialog. (The same list is reachable via the command palette `!` prefix.)
- **Markdown and HTML** checks: heading-level skips (h2 to h4), missing or empty `alt` text on images, `alt` text equal to the filename, generic link text (`click here`, `here`, `read more`, `link`), empty links, duplicate link text pointing to different targets, tables without header rows, deeply nested lists (>5), paragraphs longer than 500 words, missing `lang` attribute on `<html>`, missing page title.
- **DOCX** checks: missing alt text on inline images, heading-style skips, generic link text, tables without header rows, document language not set, missing title.
- **PDF** checks (informational): whether the PDF has any tagged structure, presence of embedded bookmarks, image-only page count, language metadata, password protection.
- **Markdown front-matter** checks: required keys present (configurable per project).
- Issues panel: list with severity (error/warning/info), location, message, and “Why this matters” explanation. `Enter` jumps to the issue, `Delete` dismisses for the session, `Ctrl+I` ignores the rule in this document (persisted in the document's sidecar).
- Two companion catalogs:
  - **Alt-text catalog** (`Ctrl+Alt+I`): every image with its current alt text, edit in place for editable formats, jump-to-source.
  - **Link inventory** (`Ctrl+Alt+L`): every link with target and accessible name; flags duplicates and internal-vs-external; copy URLs.
- Audit completes in under 200 ms for documents up to 100 KB; up to 5 s for documents up to 5 MB.

### 5.21 Table mode for Markdown and HTML tables

When the editor cursor enters a Markdown pipe table, a Markdown grid table, or an HTML `<table>`, Quill enters Table Mode and announces it.

- `Ctrl+Shift+Right` / `Ctrl+Shift+Left`: next or previous cell; the column header is announced first, then the cell content (`Column "Price": $4.99`).
- `Ctrl+Shift+Down` / `Ctrl+Shift+Up`: next or previous row in the same column.
- `F2`: open the current cell in a small editor dialog with the column header in the title.
- `Ctrl+Alt+T`: insert a row below; `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+T`: insert a column after.
- `Ctrl+Alt+R`: delete the current row; `Ctrl+Alt+C`: delete the current column. Both confirm.
- `Ctrl+Alt+H`: toggle the current row as the header row (Markdown only).
- Tables remain valid Markdown or HTML on save: Quill re-aligns pipes and pads columns on every edit so the underlying text stays readable as plain text.

### 5.22 Editor essentials

A group of small, individually unremarkable features whose absence would feel cheap. All ship in v1.0.

- **Encoding picker**: `File > Open With Encoding…`, `File > Reload With Encoding…`. Status bar shows the active encoding. Auto-detection on open via `charset-normalizer`; user can always override.
- **Line endings**: `File > Line Endings` (LF, CRLF, CR). Status bar shows the active style. “Convert on save” is an opt-in setting.
- **Reload from disk**: `Ctrl+Shift+R`. If the editor has unsaved changes, prompt.
- **External-change watcher**: detect when the file changes outside Quill; offer to reload (auto-reload if the editor is unmodified).
- **Insert date / time**: `Ctrl+Alt+D` (with a one-time format chooser that the user can re-open from Settings).
- **Templates**: `File > New From Template…`. Templates live in `%APPDATA%\Quill\templates\`. Ships with: Markdown article, Meeting notes, Daily journal, Letter, Issue report, README, Changelog, MIT license header, Markdown blog post with front-matter.
- **Word prediction**: `Ctrl+Space` opens an IntelliSense-style picker for document words plus HTML and Markdown tag completions. It can also run automatically while typing when enabled in Settings.
- **Snippets**: per-format snippet packs with trigger + Tab expansion. `Ctrl+Alt+Space` opens Insert Snippet; `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Space` opens Manage Snippets. Off by default in prose, on by default in code. Editable in Settings.
- **Save options** (per document and per workspace): trim trailing whitespace on save, ensure final newline, normalise line endings on save.
- **Smart paste**: by default, strip rich-text formatting when pasting from sources that include it.
- **Sessions**: `File > Save Session…` and `File > Open Session…` preserve the set of open documents and per-document cursor position.
- **Print**: `Ctrl+P` opens the system print dialog, preserving the editor font and encoding.
- **Extract to plain text**: `Tools > Save As Plain Text` works for any opened format and is the canonical way to harvest text from a non-editable source.
- **Compare two documents**: `Tools > Compare With File…` supports an interactive compare session and can also produce a unified-diff document in a new editor tab. Interactive compare mode moves the cursor between differing line groups, offers a difference list, and supports synchronized compare navigation. Diff hunks remain navigable with `Ctrl+]` / `Ctrl+[`.

### 5.23 Recent locations history (browser-style back/forward)

- `Ctrl+Alt+Left` moves back through cursor jump points; `Ctrl+Alt+Right` moves forward.
- Push triggers: Find match, F3/Shift+F3 jump, bookmark jump, outline jump, Go To Line, Go To Page, opening a document, switching documents.
- The ring holds up to 100 entries per editor, deduplicated when consecutive entries collapse to the same line.
- A small `Navigate → List Recent Locations…` dialog shows the ring as a list with document, line, and the line text; Enter jumps. Stock `wx.ListBox`.
- Each location remembers document path, line, column, and a hash of nearby text so jumps survive small edits exactly as bookmarks do (5.10).

### 5.24 Mark ring

A second, lighter-weight navigation system for power users. Inspired by Emacs but adapted to Windows muscle memory.
Marks are **temporary jump points**; bookmarks (5.10) are named and more durable.

- `Ctrl+Shift+M` sets an anonymous mark at the cursor; status bar briefly announces `Mark set`.
- `Ctrl+M` pops to the most recent mark; further presses walk back through the ring.
- `Ctrl+Shift+X` exchanges point (cursor) and mark, useful for jumping to where the user was and back.
- `Edit → Mark Ring → List Marks…` shows the ring in a stock `wx.ListBox` with document, line, column, and surrounding text snippet.
- Up to 50 marks in a circular buffer per session. Marks do not persist across sessions in v1.0.
- All keystrokes reassignable. `Ctrl+Space` is reserved for Word Prediction by default, so users who rely on another screen-reader chord can reassign it; the conflict detector (8.4) flags the well-known cases at install time.

### 5.25 Read Aloud (secondary voice, not the screen reader)

Quill ships a read-aloud feature that uses a **secondary** voice the user picks from a list. It deliberately does not compete with the screen reader: the screen reader keeps doing its job while read-aloud plays, and the user can use a different voice for each so they are easy to tell apart.

- Backend: SAPI 5 voices and Windows OneCore voices via `pywin32`/`comtypes`. Detected at startup; the list is presented in `Settings → Read Aloud` and in the Read Aloud voice chooser.
- `Ctrl+Alt+P` starts/pauses read-aloud from the current cursor; `Ctrl+Alt+S` stops; `Ctrl+Alt+.` skips to the next sentence; `Ctrl+Alt+,` previous.
- Granularity: sentence by default; settings allow paragraph or word.
- Highlight follows: the editor cursor moves to the start of the currently spoken sentence so when read-aloud stops, the user is exactly where they last heard. The status bar's Read Aloud cell shows progress.
- Selection-only mode: when invoked with a selection, read-aloud reads only the selection and stops at the end.
- Voice, speed, pitch, volume all configurable. Three named profiles (Reading, Proofreading, Skim) save preferred values.
- The read-aloud voice never overrides the screen reader's announcements; if a screen reader speaks something while read-aloud is active, read-aloud continues but is briefly ducked.

### 5.25b Watch Folder automation

Quill provides an optional watch-folder workflow under `BITS Whisperer -> Dictation and Watch Folder` for low-friction
document intake. Users can point Quill at one or more folders, drop supported files into them, and have Quill
process those files automatically without leaving the editor.

The original single-folder watcher has been replaced by a multi-profile **Watch Service** built on the wx-free
`quill.core.watch_service` facade. Each watch profile is an independent rule set with its own watched folder,
recursion and polling behaviour, file filters, and action (for example: open in editor, or run an intake
action). Profiles are stored through `watch_profile_store` and validated against a schema, so an invalid or
partial profile can never start a worker.

- Multiple named watch profiles can be configured and enabled or disabled independently.
- Supported drop formats follow Quill's core supported file-extension set, optionally narrowed per profile.
- Polling, subfolder recursion, and the per-profile action are configurable from Watch Folder Settings.
- A dedicated, fully accessible **Watch Queue Monitor** (`Watch` menu) lists queued, in-progress, completed,
  and failed items so users can track and retry automation without a visual dashboard.
- Watch work runs off the UI thread through `watch_worker`/`watch_queue`; results marshal back through
  `wx.CallAfter` and surface in the status/notification channel. No silent failures.
- The Startup Wizard includes watch onboarding so first-run users can configure automation immediately.

### 5.25c BITS Whisperer phased transcription rollout

Quill integrates BITS Whisperer speech capabilities in phased increments to minimize regression risk
and preserve accessibility reliability.

Phase 1 scope:

- Keep current dictation behavior stable while introducing BITS Whisperer speech model management.
- Surface model controls under `BITS Whisperer -> Speech Models`.
- Add `BITS Whisperer -> Providers` with guided provider-center flows for staged onboarding.
- Provide machine-aware default recommendations based on local configuration.
- Include faster-whisper engine readiness checks and explicit user guidance.
- Ensure `Help -> Status Page` can remain open and refresh dynamically with speech/BITS rollout task updates.
- Add rollout-safe insight surfaces under `BITS Whisperer -> Rollout` (readiness check and capability matrix).
- Add guarded download queue controls for staged model acquisition (retry failed downloads and clear history).
- Keep advanced runtime paths staged for subsequent phases.

Phase 2+ scope:

- Expand runtime model execution paths and deeper transcription behavior.
- Broaden model-family support as quality and hardware validation mature.

### 5.25a Speech Experience Platform (planned before implementation)

This section defines the next speech milestone as a complete user-facing platform, not a single settings dialog.

Goals:

- Add a first-class **Speech** submenu under the top-level **AI** menu.
- Add two downloadable local speech engines: **Kokoro** and **Piper**.
- Keep **DECtalk** and **eSpeak NG** as bundled local engines for immediate read-aloud availability.
- Provide voice lifecycle UX end to end: discover, download, preview, set preferred, configure, remove.
- Keep installer size lean by making heavier engines download-only while preserving bundled fallback voices.
- Preserve screen-reader-first behavior with predictable announcements, keyboard-first flows, and no surprise network actions.

#### 5.25a.1 AI menu information architecture

The top-level **AI** menu gains a **Speech** submenu with discoverable, keyboard-rebindable commands:

- `AI -> Speech -> Open Speech Center...`
- `AI -> Speech -> Browse Voice Library...`
- `AI -> Speech -> Download Voices...`
- `AI -> Speech -> Preview Current Voice`
- `AI -> Speech -> Set Preferred Voice...`
- `AI -> Speech -> Manage Installed Voices...`
- `AI -> Speech -> Speech Settings...`

The Speech submenu mirrors the command palette and status surfaces, with live keybinding labels exactly like other menu items.

#### 5.25a.2 Engine model and no-bundle policy

Supported engines for this milestone:

- `windows-native` (existing SAPI/OneCore path)
- `dectalk-local` (bundled)
- `espeak-local` (bundled)
- `kokoro-local`
- `piper-local`

Policy:

- DECtalk and eSpeak NG ship with QUILL as local bundled engines.
- No Kokoro or Piper voices are bundled in installer or portable artifacts.
- Voice models are downloaded on demand into `%APPDATA%\Quill\speech\voices\...`.
- Downloads require explicit user action and clear size disclosure before start.
- Speech onboarding includes preview-first guidance and availability announcements before model download.

#### 5.25a.3 Voice library and download UX

Speech Center includes a searchable voice catalog with filters:

- engine (Windows Native, Kokoro, Piper)
- language and region
- gender/style tags where available
- size band (small/medium/large)
- installed vs not installed

Each voice row exposes:

- voice name and engine
- language and locale
- on-disk size
- install state
- preferred marker

Download behavior:

- resumable downloads with progress and remaining size
- hash verification before activation
- cancellation without corrupt partial state
- failed-download recovery with retry guidance

#### 5.25a.4 Voice preview and A/B comparison

Users can preview voices before and after install.

- Preview text field with stock sample text button
- A/B preview mode for rapid compare between two selected voices
- playback controls: play, stop, replay
- optional "Preview with current speaking settings" toggle

When pre-install preview audio is available from metadata, Quill may fetch a small sample clip on demand. If no preview clip exists, preview requires install and Quill states this clearly.

#### 5.25a.5 Preferred voice and defaults model

Users can star one voice as **Preferred** with one command.

Resolution order for active voice:

1. explicit per-document override (future-compatible field)
2. explicit per-language preferred voice
3. global preferred voice
4. engine fallback voice

Setting a voice as preferred is immediate and announced in plain language.

#### 5.25a.6 Per-voice configuration and platform defaults

Every installed voice has editable settings saved as a profile, and users can mark any profile as default.

Per-voice settings (minimum set):

- rate
- pitch
- volume
- pause style and punctuation pause behavior
- sentence/paragraph chunk size
- output device selection

Platform-aware defaults:

- Windows native voices keep their own defaults
- Kokoro and Piper voices each keep separate defaults
- users can apply "Use as default for this engine" or "Use as global default"

This gives users both broad defaults and precise per-voice control.

#### 5.25a.7 Voice removal and storage hygiene

Manage Installed Voices supports safe removal:

- remove one voice
- remove all voices for selected engine
- show reclaimed disk size before confirmation
- preserve user settings history without dangling references

If the removed voice was preferred, Quill prompts for a replacement or applies deterministic fallback and announces it.

#### 5.25a.8 Speech onboarding flow

First-time speech onboarding starts when the user opens Speech Center with no installed downloadable voices.

Flow:

1. Explain available engines and that voices are optional downloads.
2. Ask preferred language/locale.
3. Recommend starter voices for Kokoro and Piper.
4. Offer quick preview where possible.
5. Download selected voices.
6. Ask user to mark preferred voice.
7. Offer one-click "Make these settings my default".

The onboarding flow can be re-run via `Help -> Run Onboarding Again` and `AI -> Speech -> Open Speech Center...`.

#### 5.25a.9 Accessibility and safety requirements

- Every Speech Center control is a stock wx control with correct label, role, and state.
- Progress updates are announced without flooding speech output.
- No auto-downloads or silent background network actions.
- All destructive actions (remove voice, reset defaults) require confirmation.
- All errors are plain-language and actionable.

#### 5.25a.10 Delivery phases (bold, realistic)

Phase 1: Foundation

- AI menu Speech submenu
- Speech Center shell
- installed-voice management for existing Windows native voices

Phase 2: Downloadable voices

- Kokoro and Piper catalog
- download, verify, install, remove
- preferred voice and per-engine defaults

Phase 3: Advanced polish

- A/B preview panel
- storage budget manager and cleanup recommendations
- per-language preferred voice routing
- richer voice profile presets (Narration, Proofread, Fast skim)

#### 5.25a.11 Acceptance criteria

- A new user can install at least one Kokoro or Piper voice in under 3 minutes from Speech Center.
- A user can preview at least two voices and set one preferred without opening Settings.
- A user can remove a voice and recover disk space with clear confirmation and fallback behavior.
- All commands are available through menu, command palette, and keybindings.
- Installer size does not increase due to bundled voice payloads.

#### 5.25a.12 DECtalk compatibility evaluation track

Quill should explicitly evaluate adding DECtalk as an optional speech engine path.

Why consider it:

- DECtalk remains important to many long-time screen-reader and speech users.
- It offers a distinctive speech character some users actively prefer for proofreading and navigation tasks.
- Community-maintained projects (including modern build efforts) suggest practical integration paths worth exploration.

Plan scope (evaluation first, not automatic ship):

- Add `dectalk-local` as a candidate engine in Speech Center behind an experimental flag.
- Prototype voice discovery, preview, and preferred-voice selection through the same Speech lifecycle model used for Kokoro and Piper.
- Keep no-bundle policy: no DECtalk voice payloads included in installer or portable builds.

Hard gates before general availability:

- **Licensing and redistribution clarity**: legal review confirms what can be downloaded, redistributed, or user-supplied.
- **Accessibility parity**: DECtalk path must pass the same screen-reader announcement, keyboard-only, and status reporting requirements as other engines.
- **Stability and performance**: startup, preview, and long-form read-aloud must meet baseline responsiveness and failure-recovery standards.
- **Configuration parity**: preferred voice, per-voice settings, per-engine defaults, and removal behavior must match other engines.

User experience requirements if approved:

- DECtalk appears in `AI -> Speech` as another engine option, not a separate workflow.
- Voice install/onboarding language is plain and explicit about source, size, and any licensing constraints.
- Users can preview and set a DECtalk voice as preferred in one flow.
- Users can remove DECtalk voices and recover storage with deterministic fallback behavior.

Positioning:

- DECtalk is treated as a high-value compatibility and user-preference path.
- It does not replace Windows native, Kokoro, or Piper; it complements them when available and compliant.

### 5.26 Number lines and strip line numbers

A small tool that addresses a real recurring user request.

- `Tools → Number Lines…` opens a dialog with format options: `1.`, `[1]`, `1:`, `1)`, `001`, and a custom Python `str.format` template using `{n}`.
- Start index, increment, zero-padding, and "only number non-blank lines" options.
- Applies to the whole document or selection.
- `Tools → Strip Line Numbers` reverses by regex; the regex used to add numbers is also the regex used to strip them.
- Undo is one step; the tool reports `Numbered 482 lines` or `Stripped numbers from 482 lines`.

### 5.27 Open from URL

- `Ctrl+Alt+O` opens a small dialog with a URL field. Accepts `http://`, `https://`, raw GitHub URLs, gist URLs, and Pastebin URLs.
- Quill downloads the resource to a per-session temp file, detects the format from the response `Content-Type` and the URL extension, and opens it with the appropriate reader.
- Network announcement: the dialog shows the host name and an estimate of bytes (where the server reports `Content-Length`) before download starts; the download is cancellable.
- The opened document has the URL as its display path, no associated file on disk; `Ctrl+S` opens Save As.
- Redirects are followed up to 5 hops; redirects to a different host prompt for confirmation.
- All TLS errors and 4xx/5xx responses are reported with a single readable sentence, no stack traces.

### 5.27a Remote Sites (FTP, SFTP, HTTPS, WebDAV, S3)

Remote I/O is the natural extension of "Open from URL": once a user has a saved site, opening and saving is one click, with the same explicit-safety guarantees.

- **File menu → Open from Remote** (default key: QUILL key then `R`) opens a two-pane site list + remote directory browser. Sites are sorted alphabetically; the user can search/filter. The dialog uses native wx controls; the directory pane is a stock `wx.ListCtrl` so screen readers can read filenames in order with no synthesized markup.
- **Save to Remote** (QUILL key then `Shift+R`) and **Save Copy to Remote...** (menu only) use the same dialog in a "Save" mode that includes a target file name field.
- **Manage Remote Sites...** (QUILL key then `Shift+M`) opens the site list editor with **New site...** / **Edit site...** / **Delete site** buttons and a per-protocol sub-dialog (FTP, SFTP, WebDAV, S3) that validates required fields before enabling Save.
- A **site** is `RemoteSite(id, name, protocol, host, port, username, root_dir, trust_first_use, extra)` with protocol-specific fields in `extra` (e.g. `s3_bucket`, `webdav_base`, `s3_endpoint`, `s3_region`, `s3_access_key`, `s3_secret_key`). Sites are persisted to `%APPDATA%\Quill\remote-sites.json` via atomic write; passwords are persisted separately through `quill/core/remote_sites.py` using the Windows Credential Manager → DPAPI file → macOS Keychain ladder.
- **Five transport modules** live in `quill/io/`, all wx-free:
  - `remote_transport.py` — `RemoteTransport` ABC + `RemoteEntry`, `DownloadResult`, `RemoteTransportError`/`RemoteAuthError`/`RemoteNotFoundError`, `chunked_copy`, `merge_headers`.
  - `http_transport.py` — `download_url(url, *, timeout, progress, max_bytes) -> HttpDownload` with verified TLS, default `_MAX_BYTES` cap, visible progress.
  - `ftp_transport.py` — FTP and FTPS open/save, MLSD time parser, listing normalization.
  - `sftp_transport.py` — paramiko SFTP open/save; honours `settings.ssh_trust_first_use` and `paramiko.AutoAddPolicy`.
  - `webdav_transport.py` — depth-1 `PROPFIND` directory listing, basic auth, parsed through `quill.core.safe_xml.fromstring` to refuse DTD/entity expansion.
  - `s3_transport.py` + `s3_sigv4.py` — manual AWS SigV4 signer for Amazon S3 and any S3-compatible endpoint; boto3 path is opportunistic and falls back to the signer when boto3 is missing.
- A document opened from a remote site is **read-only by default**; the title shows `(from site:path)` so the user always knows where it came from. `Save` on a read-only remote document opens **Save Copy to Remote...** instead of overwriting the remote.
- Network egress is gated by `quill/tools/network_egress_audit.py`; every transport call site has a written rationale. The audit is a CI gate.
- All `Save to Remote` writes use the SSH-style tilde backup: a copy of the previous file lives next to the target as `<name>~`, written in the original newline style.

### 5.28 Format-aware bracket and quote navigation

- `Ctrl+]` and `Ctrl+[` already navigate by block in editor-mode (5.17); when inside a code-aware context (code file, Markdown code fence, HTML tag), they instead jump to the matching bracket, quote, fence, or HTML tag.
- `Ctrl+Shift+\` is the explicit "Match Bracket" command (also reachable from Navigate menu).
- `Ctrl+Shift+]` extends the selection from the cursor to the matching bracket.
- Bracket matching is language-aware: respects strings and comments in supported languages; Markdown respects fence boundaries.
- The match is announced as `Matched bracket on line N, column C` so screen-reader users do not lose context.

### 5.29 Format menu (text transforms, no styling)

A dedicated menu surfacing transforms that are otherwise reachable via Tools or shortcuts. The menu exists because discoverability matters more than purity.

- Capitalisation: Upper Case, Lower Case, Title Case, Sentence Case, Toggle Case.
- Lines: Move Line Up/Down, Duplicate Line, Delete Line, Join Lines, Toggle Line Comment, Toggle Block Comment.
- Indent: Indent, Outdent, Convert to Tabs, Convert to Spaces, Set Indent Width….
- Markdown helpers: Insert Heading (levels 1–6), Insert Bullet List, Insert Numbered List, Insert Task List, Insert Table…, Insert Link…, Insert Code Block, Insert Footnote.
- Markdown list editing behavior: `Enter` continues bullet/numbered/task items, `Enter` on an empty marker exits the list, and `Tab`/`Shift+Tab` nest or promote list items when the caret is on a list line.
- List Manager: `Format -> List -> List Manager...` (`Ctrl+Alt+L`) opens a keyboard-first tree editor for moving, promoting/demoting, adding, editing, and deleting list items.
- Magical tag helpers: Insert HTML Tag… (with attribute picker) and Insert Markdown Tag… (semantic snippet picker).
- Snippet helpers: Insert Snippet… (`Ctrl+Alt+Space`) and Manage Snippets… (`Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Space`) with searchable filtering, placeholder prompts, and starter-pack onboarding.
- Prediction helpers: Word Prediction… (`Ctrl+Space`) with words, HTML tags, and Markdown tag completions.
- Surface-aware formatting shortcuts (Markdown/HTML only): `Ctrl+B` bold, `Ctrl+I` italic, and heading levels `Ctrl+Alt+1` through `Ctrl+Alt+6`.
- Re-flow: Wrap to Column…, Re-flow Paragraph.

### 5.29a Magical HTML and Markdown tag picker

- `Format → Insert HTML Tag…` opens a keyboard-first picker of common tags (`section`, `article`, headings, list/table tags, inline emphasis, links, images, code).
- After selecting a tag, Quill prompts for optional attributes in a compact `key=value; key2=value2` format and inserts valid tag text into the editor.
- If text is selected, Quill wraps the selection in the chosen non-void tag. If not selected, Quill inserts an opening/closing pair and places the cursor between them. Void tags (`img`, `br`, `hr`, `input`) are inserted self-closing.
- `Format → Insert Markdown Tag…` opens a semantic picker (`Bold`, `Italic`, `Inline Code`, `Code Block`, `Heading`, `List`, `Task List`, `Blockquote`, `Link`, `Image`, `Table`, `Footnote`) and inserts the matching markdown snippet.
- For Link and Image, Quill asks for the target URL and composes the final markdown in one action.
- All picker actions are mirrored in the command palette and are keybindable through the keymap system.
- `Edit → Insert Link…` (`Ctrl+K`) uses a format-aware inserter: markdown links in Markdown docs, `<a href>` in HTML docs, and `text (url)` form in plain text.

### 5.29b Snippet insertion and trigger expansion

- Snippets are stored locally under `%APPDATA%\Quill\snippets\snippets.json` with atomic writes.
- `Format → Insert Snippet…` opens the same keyboard-first searchable picker pattern used across Quill insertion flows.
- Supported placeholders in snippet bodies: `${input:name}`, `${choice:a|b}`, `${date}`, `${time}`, `${cursor}`.
- Trigger expansion can run while typing (for example `;meeting` plus a delimiter), and remains user-controllable via General Preferences.
- Starter packs are installable from Preferences and snippet management so onboarding can begin with practical templates.

### 5.29c Word prediction and tag IntelliSense

- `Ctrl+Space` opens a prediction picker that reuses the same accessible searchable-pattern UX as other insertion dialogs.
- Predictions draw from the current document words, the merged spell dictionaries, and the HTML/Markdown tag vocabularies Quill already ships.
- When enabled in General Preferences, the same helper can auto-refresh while typing so the prediction list follows the current fragment.
- Accepting a prediction inserts the chosen word or tag completion at the caret; Escape dismisses the popup without changing text.

### 5.30 Bookmark export and import

- `Tools → Bookmarks → Export…` writes the bookmark set for the current document to a single JSON file alongside its hash so it round-trips cleanly.
- `Tools → Bookmarks → Import…` adds bookmarks from a file, with a preview dialog showing each bookmark and a per-row checkbox.
- Conflict resolution: on import, identical names produce a numbered suffix; identical positions are merged.
- A second action, `Tools → Bookmarks → Export All…`, writes every bookmark across every document the user has ever opened, useful for moving machines.

### 5.31 Trusted locations (Office-style)

- `Settings → Privacy → Trusted Locations` is a list of folders Quill opens without extra prompts.
- Files opened from outside trusted locations that are unusually large (default >25 MB), password-protected, or in a Grade B/C format show a one-time prompt: `Open <path>?` with Open, Open and Trust this folder, Cancel.
- Network-mounted folders are never auto-trusted; a setting must enable them explicitly.
- The trusted locations list is editable, exportable, and importable.

### 5.32 Jump List and shell integration

- Windows Taskbar Jump List shows Recent Files (last 10) and Pinned Files; Tasks include `New Document`, `Open File…`, and `Open from URL…`.
- Implementation via `pywin32`'s `ICustomDestinationList`.
- Shell context menu entries (registered from `Settings → Files`):
  - `Open with Quill` for every registered extension.
  - `Open with Quill (As Plain Text)` for every text-like extension, forcing the plain-text reader regardless of detected format.
  - **Open Folder With Quill** is deferred to v1.1 (it implies a folder-tree panel).
- All shell verbs install per-user (no admin elevation required) and uninstall cleanly.

### 5.33 Diagnostics and bug reporting

- `Help → Report a Bug…` is the unified support flow. It opens an in-app review screen with the report summary and destination URL, supports optional diagnostics zip generation, copies the environment summary to the clipboard, and then opens a pre-filled Community Access support-hub issue form in the default browser with no logs; the user reviews and submits manually.
- `Help → Save Diagnostics…` remains available for standalone diagnostics export and writes a zip with:
  - the last 7 days of logs (action names and outcomes only; no document content),
  - settings (with API keys redacted),
  - the active keymap,
  - the last 50 commands executed,
  - the screen-reader detection result and version (if available),
  - basic environment info (Windows build, Python build, wxPython build, locale).
- Nothing leaves the machine. The user chooses where to save the zip and what to do with it.

### 5.34 Welcome and Keyboard Reference

- **Welcome** opens a tutorial document in a new tab that walks new users through the editor, command palette, outline navigator, find/F3, spell check, and accessibility audit. The document is editable; users can save their own annotated copy.
- **Keyboard Reference** is auto-generated from the current keymap and opens as a Markdown document in the editor. It is grouped by menu, includes the "when" context for each binding, and updates the next time the user opens it after any rebind. Because it is just a document, users can search it with Find, jump with the Outline Navigator, and print it.
- **Tip of the Day** is off by default; when on, it appears once per launch as a small dismissible dialog with a single tip drawn from real palette actions, each tip a one-liner with a `Try it` button that runs the action.

### 5.35 Notifications centre

- The status bar's **Notifications** cell holds Quill's announcements: available updates, recovered autosave snapshots offered on launch, finished AI tasks, finished long-running OCR or extraction jobs, and any plugin messages.
- `Enter` on the cell opens a small Notifications dialog (stock `wx.ListBox` with timestamps); Delete dismisses individual entries; `Shift+Delete` dismisses all.
- Quill never raises toast or balloon notifications. All asynchronous events surface here and on the status bar's Background Tasks cell.

### 5.36 "What changed on save" (opt-in)

- Off by default. When on (`Settings → Reading → Announce save summary`), every successful save announces a one-liner: `Saved chapter-7.md, 4 lines changed, 38 words added`.
- Computed by diffing the previous saved bytes against the new bytes; cheap on documents up to 5 MB.
- Useful for ambient awareness during long editing sessions; trivially ignorable for users who prefer silence.

### 5.37 Link tools

A small family of related commands that make working with links comfortable for screen-reader users.

- **Insert link** (`Ctrl+K`): opens a small dialog with URL and display text fields. If a URL is on the clipboard, the URL field is pre-filled. If a selection exists, it becomes the display text. Enter inserts `[text](url)` in Markdown, `<a href="url">text</a>` in HTML, a plain URL in plain text, and a properly escaped link in reStructuredText, AsciiDoc, Org, and Textile. Cancel restores the cursor.
- **Insert quoted text** (`Ctrl+Shift+>`): indents the selection by one level of `>` for Markdown and email-style replies. `Ctrl+Shift+<` dedents one level. `Tools → Strip Quote Markers` removes them entirely. Idempotent: re-indenting a block already at level N goes to N+1, not back to 1.
- **Follow link** (`Ctrl+Enter`): when the cursor is on a Markdown link, HTML `href`, or a plain URL, opens it in the default browser. The status bar announces the destination host first (`Opening github.com…`) so the user always knows what they are about to open. Anchor links inside the current document jump in-editor instead.
- **Reveal link target** (`Ctrl+Shift+Enter`): announces the target without opening it (`Link target: https://example.com/path`).
- **Copy link target** (`Ctrl+Alt+K`): copies the URL of the link under the cursor.

### 5.38 Document properties and front-matter

- **Document properties dialog** (`File → Document Properties…`): edit document language (BCP-47 tag), title, author, description, keywords. For DOCX, EPUB, HTML, ODT these write into the document's metadata in place; for plain text, Markdown, reStructuredText, AsciiDoc, Org, and Typst they write into a sidecar `<filename>.quill.yml`. The document language drives the spell-check dictionary stack automatically.
- **Front-matter editor** (`Ctrl+Alt+F`): when the cursor is in or above YAML or TOML front-matter (Jekyll, Hugo, Zola, Quarto, Pandoc styles), opens a structured editor. Each key becomes a labelled `wx.StaticText` plus `wx.TextCtrl` pair. Save writes back as valid YAML or TOML, preserving comments and ordering wherever possible. New keys can be added; required keys (configurable per project) are highlighted.
- The front-matter editor recognises common keys (`title`, `date`, `author`, `tags`, `categories`, `draft`, `slug`, `description`, `lang`, `permalink`) and gives them sensible widgets (date picker for dates, multi-line for description, etc.). Unknown keys get a plain text field.

### 5.39 Autosave control and persistent undo

- **Autosave** is on by default at 30-second intervals. The status bar gains an **Autosave** cell showing `Autosave: 30 s` or `Autosave: off`. Enter cycles 15 s, 30 s, 60 s, 5 min, off. Settings dialog exposes the same plus a custom interval.
- **Persistent undo** keeps each document's undo stack alongside its autosave snapshots. Reopening a recently closed document restores up to 100 undo steps. Off by default for plain-text files larger than 5 MB. Stored in `%APPDATA%\Quill\undo\<hash>.undo`, atomically written, auto-pruned at 30 days.
- **Crash-safe autosave**: snapshots write to `…snap.tmp` and rename to `…snap` on flush so a power loss mid-write cannot corrupt the recovery store.

### 5.40 Paragraph, line, and footnote refinements

- **Join paragraph** (`Ctrl+Shift+J`): collapses a wrapped paragraph (the kind produced by plain-text email or older PDF extracts) into a single line, preserving sentence-internal spacing. Works on the current paragraph or selection. Idempotent.
- **Move line preserves selection**: `Alt+Up` / `Alt+Down` (line move, 5.18) keep the same logical selection range so the user does not lose context after moving.
- **Markdown heading auto-numbering** (`Tools → Toggle Heading Numbers`): adds `1.`, `1.1`, `1.1.1` prefixes across all headings, re-numbering in document order. Re-running removes them. Idempotent. Works in HTML, AsciiDoc, reStructuredText, Org, Typst as well.
- **Footnote helper**:
  - `Ctrl+Alt+.` (period) inserts a Markdown footnote pair at the cursor and jumps the cursor into the definition block; pressing `Ctrl+Alt+.` again returns to the reference site.
  - `Tools → Renumber Footnotes` reorders footnote labels into document order (1, 2, 3…), updating both references and definitions.
  - The same command works for reStructuredText auto-numbered footnotes (`[#]_`) and Pandoc-style inline notes.

### 5.41 Search-and-replace preview and saved searches

- **Replace preview**: when a Replace All would change more than 25 occurrences (threshold configurable), Quill shows a preview dialog listing up to the first 50 changes with line numbers and before/after text. Buttons: Replace All, Cancel, Replace Selected (in case the user unticks rows). Always shows the total count.
- **Saved searches**: a search term plus its options (case, whole word, regex, in-selection) can be saved under a name via `Find → Save This Search…`. `Ctrl+Shift+F3` opens the saved-search picker (stock `wx.ListBox`); Enter runs it as if F3 had been pressed. Stored in `%APPDATA%\Quill\saved-searches.json`, exportable/importable.

### 5.42 Sort and transform details

`Tools → Sort Selected Lines…` and the related transforms (5.18) are spec'd here in full:

- Direction: ascending or descending.
- Case sensitivity: on or off.
- Numeric mode: lexicographic (`item10` before `item2`) or natural-numeric (`item2` before `item10`).
- Date-aware mode: parse leading ISO-8601 or `dd/mm/yyyy` dates; sort chronologically.
- Header row: preserved as the first line if checked.
- Stable sort always; equal lines preserve their relative order.
- Remove Duplicate Lines: optional "keep first" vs. "keep last"; reports `Removed 13 duplicate lines, 287 remain`.
- Reverse Lines: simple reverse, preserves blank lines.

### 5.43 Save All with conflict detection and per-file format memory

- **Save All** (`Ctrl+Alt+S` reserved; default is `Ctrl+Shift+Alt+S` so it doesn't clash with Document Statistics) saves every modified document. If the external watcher detects that one or more files changed on disk since they were opened, Save All opens a per-file resolution dialog: Keep Mine, Take Theirs, Open Diff. Defaults to Keep Mine with no destructive action until the user confirms.
- **Per-file format memory**: Quill remembers per-path the user's last choices for encoding, line endings, wrap, indent width, tabs-vs-spaces, and spell-check language. On reopening the file those settings are restored. Setting toggle: `Settings → Files → Remember per-file format choices` (on by default). Storage in `%APPDATA%\Quill\file-prefs.json`, keyed by SHA-1 of the path.

### 5.44 Per-document scratchpad

- `Ctrl+Alt+N` opens a small non-modal Scratchpad window tied to the current document. The Scratchpad is a second `wx.TextCtrl` with its own save and word count.
- Each scratchpad is persisted at `%APPDATA%\Quill\notes\<hash>.md` keyed by document path.
- When the underlying document is moved or renamed, Quill detects the orphan note next time the document is opened and offers `Re-attach note to current document?` (Yes / No / Show note).
- Scratchpads use the same spell-check stack as their parent document but are excluded from accessibility audits.

### 5.45 Section folding (announce-only)

A folding model designed for screen-reader users: folded ranges are summarised aloud and never visually hidden in a way that confuses the cursor.

- `Ctrl+Shift+[` folds the section starting at the heading on or above the current line into a single summary line: `Section "Background" — 14 lines hidden`.
- `Ctrl+Shift+]` unfolds the section at the cursor.
- `Ctrl+Shift+K Ctrl+Shift+0` folds all sections to a given level (chord sequence); `Ctrl+Shift+K Ctrl+Shift+J` unfolds all.
- Folding state is per-session and never written to file.
- Find still finds matches inside folded ranges and automatically unfolds on jump.
- Outline Navigator (5.16) is the primary navigation tool; folding is the in-editor companion.

### 5.46 Spell-check ignore directives and manual bilingual flag

- **Per-document ignore directives**. Quill honours a magic comment that lists words to ignore in this document only:
  - HTML / Markdown: `<!-- quill: ignore-spell "frobnicate", "wibble" -->`
  - Plain text and code (using the file's comment marker): `# quill: ignore-spell frobnicate, wibble`
  - YAML / TOML front-matter: `quill_ignore_spell: [frobnicate, wibble]`
- The ignore set is merged into the active dictionary stack as a transient per-document layer.
- **Manual bilingual paragraph flag** (`Ctrl+Alt+B`): toggles a per-paragraph language override. The user types or picks a BCP-47 tag; the paragraph is marked in the sidecar `.quill.yml`; the spell-check stack swaps for that paragraph. Per-paragraph auto-detection remains in the backlog; this manual flow is reliable today.

### 5.47 Word boundary mode, trailing whitespace, case-change announcement

- **Word boundary mode** (`Settings → Editing → Word Boundary Mode`):
  - **Default**: Unicode word breaks (UAX #29). Best for prose.
  - **Whitespace**: only whitespace separates words. Best for log files.
  - **Programmer**: also breaks on `_`, `-`, `.`, and case transitions (`getFoo` is three "words": `get`, `Foo`, plus the case boundary). Best for code.
- The mode affects `Ctrl+Left`/`Right`, `Ctrl+Delete`/`Backspace`, double-click selection, word count, and the spell-check tokeniser.
- **Trailing whitespace announcement**: when the cursor lands on a line that ends with trailing whitespace, the status bar's Line/Column cell appends `(trailing whitespace)` and a screen-reader-friendly hint is available via Where Am I. No visual highlight; no extra speech while typing.
- **Case-change announcement guard**: when `Ctrl+U`, `Ctrl+L`, or `Ctrl+Shift+T` apply to the whole document because nothing was selected, the announcement explicitly says so and reminds the user `Press Ctrl+Z to undo full-document case change`.

### 5.48 Multi-format export and reading view

- **Export panel** (`File → Export…`): one dialog with target format choices: HTML, DOCX, plain text, Markdown, reStructuredText, and PDF (via Markdown → HTML → system print-to-PDF). Per-format options inline (heading numbering, table-of-contents inclusion, embedded CSS yes/no, page size for PDF).
- **Reading view** (`View → Toggle Reading View`): toggles the editor between source view and a clean reading representation for HTML and Markdown. Still a `wx.TextCtrl` — same accessibility, just a different render: links unwrapped to `text (url)`, headings prefixed by their level, lists rendered with consistent markers, code blocks framed by a horizontal rule. Editing is disabled in reading view (the cell announces this); toggle off to edit.

### 5.49 Welcome-back snapshot

- On launch, if the user closed Quill cleanly with N documents open last time, a single prompt offers `Reopen the 3 documents from your last session?` with Yes / No / Show me.
- "Show me" opens a small list of the documents (paths, last cursor positions) and lets the user pick a subset.
- Always opt-in per launch; the global "restore session" setting is separate and stays off by default.

### 5.50 Per-document keymap override (with explicit consent)

- A document's sidecar `.quill.yml` may declare a `keymap_override` block.
- Quill never applies it silently. On opening such a document, the user sees a one-time confirmation: `This document requests a different keymap. Apply for this document only?` with Yes / No / Always for this document. The decision is remembered per-document path.
- Overrides are scoped: they only apply while the document has focus, never global.
- A small lock icon appears in the document name status-bar cell (announced as `keymap override active`) whenever an override is in effect.

### 5.51 Settings export, import, and partitioned reset

- `Settings → Export…` writes a single zip containing settings, keymap, templates, snippets, personal dictionary, saved searches, and bookmarks. API keys are excluded; the user is told so explicitly in the dialog.
- `Settings → Import…` previews every change in a stock `wx.ListBox` and requires Enter to commit. Conflicts (e.g. a keymap rebind that contradicts the current keymap) are flagged inline.
- `Settings → Reset to Defaults…` opens a partitioned reset dialog with checkboxes for: Keymap, Appearance, Spell-check learning, Templates and snippets, Recent files, Bookmarks, Everything. Never silent; every reset shows a confirmation listing what will be lost.

### 5.52 Document fingerprint

- Every saved document has a SHA-256 fingerprint of its bytes shown in `File → Document Properties…` and copyable from a button.
- Useful for accessibility certification workflows where the user must prove they reviewed a specific version, and for forensic comparison.
- The fingerprint also surfaces in the diagnostics bundle (5.33) for any open document, scrubbed of path.

### 5.53 Unicode insert

- `Ctrl+Alt+U` opens a search dialog over the Unicode name database (`unicodedata` from the standard library). Type any part of a character name; matching characters appear in a stock `wx.ListBox` with code point, name, and the literal character.
- Categories shown as one-line filters: Letters, Marks, Numbers, Punctuation, Symbols, Separators, Other. Click or type the category prefix to scope.
- Pinned favourites for common needs: em-dash, en-dash, ellipsis, smart quotes, currency symbols, mathematical operators.
- Recent characters list keeps the last 20.

### 5.54 Idle-time prefetch

- When the user opens a file from a folder, Quill background-extracts the next and previous files alphabetically into the in-memory document cache so opening them feels instant.
- Bounded by available memory and by a hard cap of 50 MB total prefetch.
- Cancelled immediately on any other extraction or AI task.
- Opt-out switch in `Settings → General → Prefetch neighbouring files`.

### 5.55 Atomic on-disk stores

- All Quill-managed JSON stores (bookmarks, settings, keymap, recent, saved searches, file prefs, notes index) write to `<store>.tmp` and rename atomically.
- A `<store>.bak` is kept of the last good version. On startup, if the primary store fails to parse, Quill renames it to `<store>.broken-<timestamp>.json`, falls back to the `.bak`, and announces `Recovered <store> from backup`.
- This eliminates the worst class of "my bookmarks vanished after a crash" bugs.

### 5.56 First-run onboarding

A five-step welcome flow the first time Quill launches. Each step is a normal modal page (no carousel, no animation). Skip is always available; the chosen values are written through the same Settings code path as any later change.

1. **Profile**: System, Word-like, Vim, Emacs.
2. **Theme**: System, Light, Dark, High Contrast.
3. **Spell-check languages**: multi-select from the bundled launch set; the active document language is added automatically when later opened.
4. **AI provider**: Off (default), Ollama local, Ollama Cloud, OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Anthropic/Claude, OpenRouter, Gemini, or a custom OpenAI-compatible endpoint. Providers include sensible default hosts where possible; advanced custom mode allows manual endpoint override. If a provider is picked, the API-key dialog opens when required; the key is stored via Windows Credential Manager with a DPAPI-encrypted fallback (10.11). Network is never used without explicit per-action consent.
5. **Telemetry**: confirms it stays off (default). A short plain-language sentence explains what telemetry would collect if turned on later.

The onboarding completion writes `%APPDATA%\Quill\onboarding-complete.json`. Trust and privacy consent acknowledgement is stored separately in `%APPDATA%\Quill\trust-consent.json` and is versioned so policy text updates can require re-acknowledgement. Re-running `Help → Run Onboarding Again` reopens the flow without resetting anything else.

### 5.57 Privacy summary

- A single-screen plain-language statement of what Quill does and does not send over the network. Linked from `Help → Privacy Summary` and shown once during onboarding.
- Content is audited by the cognitive-accessibility plain-language linter (9.8): Flesch ≥ 60, controlled vocabulary, one idea per sentence.
- Says explicitly: documents never leave the machine without an explicit per-action confirmation; the only outbound calls v1.0 makes without confirmation are the manual update check and the optional crash-report upload (5.71), both opt-in.

### 5.58 Licenses screen

- `Help → Licenses` opens `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md` (auto-generated at build time, 10.2.4) in the editor.
- The file lists every bundled component, its version, its license text, and a one-line use justification.
- Required for procurement; required by some bundled licenses.

### 5.59 Crash recovery transparency

When Quill detects an autosave snapshot newer than the on-disk file on launch:

- The recovery dialog names the file, the snapshot timestamp, the byte count, and offers four actions: **Recover**, **Compare with on-disk**, **Discard snapshot**, **Cancel** (decide later).
- **Compare with on-disk** opens the diff view (5.22) immediately.
- The dialog is screen-reader-friendly first: every value is a separate labelled `wx.StaticText` so it reads cleanly.
- Choosing Recover writes the snapshot as a new unsaved document; the on-disk file is **never** overwritten without an explicit Save.

### 5.60 Read-only document mode

- `View → Read-Only Mode` (`Ctrl+Shift+L` by default) toggles the editor's editability without touching file permissions.
- Toggle state is per-document; announced when toggled (`Read-only mode on` / `off`).
- Status bar's **Modified state** cell shows `Read-only` while on; attempts to type are silently ignored and a single discreet announcement (`Editor is read-only; press Ctrl+Shift+L to allow editing`) fires the first time per session.
- All navigation, Find, Outline, Read Aloud, Statistics, and Accessibility Audit continue to work.

### 5.61 File-related menu helpers

- `File → Reveal in File Explorer` opens Explorer with the current file selected.
- `File → Copy Full Path`, `File → Copy File Name` copy the corresponding string to the clipboard with a confirmation announcement.
- `File → Show Containing Folder in Quill` is deferred to v1.1 (depends on the folder panel).

### 5.62 Open Recent enhancements

- `File → Open Recent` includes per-entry **Pin / Unpin** and a top-level **Open All Pinned** action.
- Pinned items are not subject to the recent-list cap (default 10) and appear at the top of the submenu.
- Pinned entries are persisted in `recent.json` and survive Clear Recent (which only clears unpinned entries).

### 5.63 Document timeline

- `Tools → Document Timeline…` opens a chronological list (stock `wx.ListBox`) of every backup and autosave snapshot for the current document, with timestamp, size, and source (save backup vs. autosave snapshot).
- Each row has **Open in new tab**, **Compare with current**, and **Restore** (with confirmation) actions.
- The backing store already exists (5.13 + 5.39); this is the unified UI on top.
- Per-document, never global.

### 5.64 Sentence and paragraph navigation

- `Ctrl+Up` / `Ctrl+Down` already navigate by paragraph (standard wx behaviour).
- `Alt+Right` / `Alt+Left` move to the next / previous **sentence** and announce the sentence text (truncated to 200 characters around the cursor for braille and speech).
- Sentence detection uses the `regex` Unicode word-boundary tables plus a per-language abbreviation list (`Mr.`, `Dr.`, `e.g.`, etc.) that ships with each Hunspell language pack and is user-extendable in Settings.
- `Ctrl+Shift+Alt+Right` / `Ctrl+Shift+Alt+Left` extend the selection by sentence.

### 5.65 Word-count goal per document

- `File → Document Properties…` gains a **Word goal** integer field (0 disables).
- The status bar's **Word count** cell appends `(243 of 1500)` when a goal is set; on crossing the threshold Quill announces `Word goal reached: 1500 words`.
- The goal is stored alongside other metadata in the document container or in the `.quill.yml` sidecar.

### 5.66 Reading position memory per document

- On close, Quill records cursor line/column and scroll offset for the current document.
- On reopen, the cursor is restored; the status bar announces `Restored to line N` on first focus into the editor.
- Storage keyed by the document's path SHA-1 in `file-prefs.json` (10.5).
- Setting toggle `Settings → Editing → Restore reading position` (on by default).
- Independent of Welcome-Back snapshot (5.49); works even when only a single document is opened directly from Explorer.

### 5.67 Compare with clipboard

- `Tools → Compare With Clipboard` runs the unified-diff machinery (5.22) with the current document as `before` and the clipboard contents as `after`.
- Useful when reviewing a single suggestion pasted from chat or email.
- Refuses if the clipboard is empty or larger than 5 MB; explains why.

### 5.68 Insert from file

- `File → Insert From File…` inserts another file's text at the current cursor without opening it as a separate document.
- Uses the same format detection as Open; for non-text formats Quill extracts plain text and confirms before inserting.
- Files over 1 MB show a confirmation dialog with the byte count and the first line of content.

### 5.69 Selection-statistics direct shortcut

- `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+S` runs Document Statistics scoped to the current selection without first opening the full-document dialog.
- Same dialog as 5.19 but with the title prefixed `Statistics — Selection`.
- Reassignable like any other binding.

### 5.70 Audio cue catalogue (opt-in)

- A small set of subtle, brief, screen-reader-respectful audio cues. Off by default; settings live in `Settings → Sounds`.
- Catalogue (v1.0):
  - **Save success** — 80 ms soft click at 600 Hz.
  - **Save failure** — 120 ms low descending pair.
  - **Find: no match** — 100 ms muted tick at 400 Hz.
  - **Autosave snapshot taken** — 60 ms whisper at 800 Hz (the quietest cue).
  - **Background task complete** — 120 ms two-tone chime.
- All cues are ≤ 120 ms, share a single low-default volume slider, and **duck** automatically while a screen reader is speaking (detected via the SR detection layer, 10.1).
- Cues are PCM data bundled with the app, played via `winsound.PlaySound` with `SND_ASYNC | SND_MEMORY` so they never block.
- Per-cue on/off in Settings.

### 5.71 Quiet mode

- `View → Quiet Mode` (`Ctrl+Alt+Q` by default) is a single toggle that:
  - hides the status bar (still reachable via F6 announcement only),
  - suppresses non-critical announcements (autosave summary, idle-prefetch chatter, Tip of the Day),
  - sets audio cues volume to zero for the session,
  - leaves all critical announcements intact (errors, save failures, AI completion).
- Announced on toggle (`Quiet mode on` / `off`).
- Useful for high-focus writing sessions; state is per-session and not persisted.

### 5.72 Temporary trust for untrusted-location opens

- The Trusted Locations prompt (5.31) gains a third button: **Open this time only**.
- The file opens; the folder is **not** added to trusted locations.
- Useful for one-off opens from Downloads or temp folders without expanding the trust footprint.

### 5.73 Settings search

- A search field at the top of the Settings dialog (`Ctrl+F` when focus is in Settings).
- Indexes setting key, label, description, and a synonym list maintained alongside each setting.
- As the user types, the tree filters to matching settings; the first match is announced.
- `Esc` clears the filter; `Tab` moves to the tree.
- The synonym list is gettext-translated alongside labels.

### 5.74 In-app changelog and update transparency

- `Help → Release Notes` opens a Markdown document with one section per version. Auto-generated from `CHANGELOG.md` at build time.
- The manual update dialog (5.34, 10.12) links to the release notes for the version it is offering, shows the published date when the feed provides it, and lets the user **Skip this version**, **Download**, or decide **Later**.
- Past release notes remain reachable through the document's own outline (5.16).

### 5.75 Crash-report opt-in (per recovery)

- When Quill recovers from a crash, the recovery dialog includes an opt-in checkbox: **Send crash details to the Quill team (no document content)**.
- If checked, the diagnostics bundle (5.33) is uploaded over HTTPS to a host shown explicitly in the dialog before send; the upload is cancellable and shows a progress announcement.
- Off by default; the choice is **remembered per recovery session only**, never globally — this prevents accidental long-term opt-in.
- Crash reports include logs, environment, and the last 50 commands, never document content or API keys.

### 5.76 Interactive compare mode

Quill provides two complementary comparison workflows: an accessible interactive compare session and a generated diff report.

- **Compare commands**: `Tools → Compare Documents…`, `Tools → Compare With File…`, `Tools → Compare Open Documents…`, `Tools → Compare Selection With Clipboard`, plus `Tools → Compare Options…`.
- **Core navigation**: `F8` next difference, `Shift+F8` previous difference, `Ctrl+F8` announce current difference, `Alt+F8` open Difference List, `Ctrl+Alt+F8` toggle synchronized compare navigation.
- **Interactive session**: focus stays in the active editor; moving to a difference places the cursor on the changed line and announces both sides in plain language.
- **Difference List**: a stock list control containing all differences with document names, line numbers, type, and a short preview; Enter jumps to the selected difference.
- **Compare options**: ignore leading/trailing spaces, all whitespace, blank lines, line endings, case, punctuation, repeated spaces, Markdown heading markers, HTML tag differences, and normalized Unicode.
- **Difference summary**: users may create a plain-text summary document listing all differences, options used, and short before/after excerpts.
- **Diff report**: Quill may also generate a unified-diff document in a new editor tab. Diff hunks remain navigable with `Ctrl+]` and `Ctrl+[`.
- **Extracted document compare**: PDF, DOCX, EPUB, OCR, and repaired text compare against Quill’s extracted text representation, with a warning that extraction quality may affect results.
- **Feature profiles**: interactive compare is on in Writer, Reader and Student, Office and Admin, Accessibility Professional, Developer and Power Text, and Full Quill; it is quiet in Essential.

### 5.58 Ask Quill — on-device AI chat (WebView)

Ask Quill is a conversational assistant that runs entirely on the user's machine — no cloud, no API keys. It can answer questions, write or rewrite text for the document, and run Quill commands, but it is screen-reader-first and approval-gated: nothing touches the document until the user approves it. This is the crawl-before-run 1.0 surface; a deeper native integration is future work.

**On-device backends (platform-selected).** `make_default_backend()` picks the backend by platform — Apple Foundation Models on macOS, and **llama.cpp (`llama-cpp-python`, CPU, GGUF)** on Windows and Linux. There is no server and no GPU requirement. On Windows the model runs in-process on the CPU.

- **Model manager (RAM-tiered, auto-download).** On first use the backend resolves a model: `QUILL_LLAMA_MODEL` (explicit `.gguf` path) → an existing `*.gguf` in `<app data>/models` → otherwise it downloads the RAM-appropriate model with progress announced. Machines under ~8 GB RAM get **Llama 3.2 1B**; otherwise **Phi-4-mini (Q4)**.
- **Model is a setting, not a chore.** The model choice is exposed in the AI Model settings dialog (dropdown + Download Now) and during onboarding — users are never asked to "drop a GGUF." Onboarding first asks **"Do you want to use AI?"**; the model controls only appear if they say yes. Model descriptions avoid em-dashes.
- **Graceful CPU fallback.** If the prebuilt llama.cpp hits an unsupported CPU instruction (`STATUS_ILLEGAL_INSTRUCTION 0xC000001D` — e.g. AVX2 missing under x64-on-ARM emulation such as Parallels on Apple Silicon), the backend converts the `OSError` into a plain-language message explaining that the CPU lacks AVX2 and suggesting a no-AVX / native build, instead of crashing.

**The whole chat lives in a WebView (Edge WebView2 on Windows).** Transcript, suggestions, _and the message edit field_ are all rendered as HTML in `wx.html2.WebView` — which is **Edge WebView2** on Windows (WKWebView on macOS, WebKitGTK on Linux). We deliberately render in the WebView rather than a plain list box + separate text field because it gives us formatted Markdown (the assistant's headings, lists, and code render properly) together with the browser engine's native, mature accessibility, and keeps the user in one place. `wx.html2.WebView` is a factory-created native control and cannot be meaningfully subclassed, so accessibility is driven by the **HTML we render**, via a thin wrapper (`AccessibleWebView`):

- An **ARIA live region** (`<main role="log" aria-live="polite">`) so each new message is announced automatically by NVDA / JAWS / Narrator without the user moving focus.
- An assertive `role="status"` region for transient state ("Quill is responding", "Quill responded").
- Each message is an `<article>` with a heading (the speaker), so users can navigate the transcript by heading.
- **The edit field is in the page** — a labelled `<textarea>` with a Send button. Enter sends, Shift+Enter inserts a newline. Submissions post back to Python over a **script-message bridge** (`window.quill.postMessage` ↔ `EVT_WEBVIEW_SCRIPT_MESSAGE_RECEIVED`) which drives the on-device assistant directly. The wx text field only appears in the list-box fallback when no WebView backend exists.
- **Suggested prompts disappear after the first message** (like Apple Intelligence): they show on open so the user has a starting point, then hide themselves once the conversation begins so they never sit in the way of the chat.
- `lang`, viewport, readable type, and high-contrast / `forced-colors` CSS.
- The greeting is **baked into the initial page** so there is no "empty then rendered" flash on open. Messages and state changes that arrive before the page finishes loading are queued and replayed on the `LOADED` event.

**Focus lands in the web view's edit field on open (screen-reader behavior).** When the chat opens, focus is moved directly into the in-page message field (`AccessibleWebView.focus()` → focuses the `<textarea>`, via `wx.CallAfter`) rather than onto surrounding chrome — so the user "jumps into the web view" ready to type, and the screen reader starts inside the live conversation. After a reply we do **not** steal focus back (the live region already announced it); after an approval we return focus to the edit field. (Implemented in `AskQuillChatDialog.show()` / `_focus_composer()`.)

**Prism announcements (screen-reader-first).** In addition to the WebView's ARIA live region, Quill uses the **Prism (`prismatoid`) bridge on Windows** to send response text straight to the active screen reader, so the user hears new replies even without alt-tabbing to the chat. Prism never speaks over a running screen reader — its SAPI / pyttsx3 fallback is suppressed whenever a screen reader is detected.

**Approval before anything is applied.** Each turn the assistant _decides_ (`answer` / `insert` / `replace` / `run`) but never edits the document automatically. Insert/replace text and command runs are shown as a proposal with an Approve / Discard bar; focus moves to **Approve** and the screen reader is told a change is proposed. Only on Approve does Quill insert, replace the selection, or run the command. There is also Copy Last Response and labeled suggestion prompts.

**Discoverability and reliability.** Ask Quill lives under a top-level **AI** menu (Alt+I) alongside the "Use Artificial Intelligence" toggle and AI Model settings. Generation runs off the UI thread. The single-instance lock self-heals (PID + creation-time identity) so a stale lock from a crash never blocks launch.

### 5.77 Copy Tray — twelve-slot persistent clipboard

Copy Tray gives users twelve independently addressable clipboard slots that survive application restarts. Each slot holds text explicitly placed there; slots are written atomically to disk on every change.

**Motivation.** The system clipboard holds one item and is shared across every running application. Screen-reader users who work across multiple documents, do research from multiple sources, or paste recurring fragments (signatures, disclaimers, code boilerplate) lose clipboard contents constantly because any copy from any app overwrites it. Copy Tray is a private, persistent alternative.

**Core operations.**

- **Copy to slot N** — copies the current selection to slot N (1–12). Reports the slot number, optional label, and a text preview through the screen-reader bridge.
- **Paste from slot N** — inserts the slot's text at the cursor (or replaces the selection). Reports slot number and label. Supports multi-press: single=paste, double=peek, triple=open dialog.
- **Copy to Next Empty Slot** (`edit.copy_to_next_slot`) — copies the selection to the first unoccupied, unpinned slot in order 1–12. Announces which slot was used. If all slots are occupied, announces this rather than silently overwriting.
- **Search Tray Slots** (`edit.search_tray_slots`) — opens a minimal search dialog. User types a query; QUILL searches all slot text and labels and announces matches. The user can press a digit key to paste that slot directly.
- **Open Copy Tray dialog** — shows all twelve slots with slot number, optional label, and a text preview. Inline editing of content and label; auto-save on slot change. Includes Pin/Unpin button.
- **Set label** — names a slot with a short string. Labels are spoken in all subsequent announcements, visible in the dialog, and shown in the Paste from Tray submenu alongside a text preview.
- **Pin / Unpin** — marks a slot as pinned from the dialog. Pinned slots are never overwritten by next-empty routing and are announced with a "pinned" prefix.
- **Clear All Tray Slots** — empties all twelve slots after a Yes/No confirmation defaulting to No.

**Multi-press paste.** The paste chord supports three levels of intent:

| Press count | Behaviour |
| --- | --- |
| Single | Paste slot content at cursor |
| Double | Peek: announce slot content without pasting |
| Triple | Open Copy Tray dialog focused on that slot |

The press window is configurable via `multi_press_window_ms` (default 400 ms, range 100–1000 ms; found in `App > Preferences > Editing`). This lets expert users check what a slot holds before committing — useful for a crowded tray where memory may be unreliable.

**Paste submenu slot labels.** The `Edit > Copy Tray > Paste from Tray` menu shows each slot's label and a text preview inline (e.g. "1  signature — Hi, I wanted to follow..."). Screen readers read both columns when navigating the submenu.

**Status bar cell.** The `copy_tray_slots` status bar cell shows `Slots: X/12` (occupied count). Clicking it opens the Copy Tray dialog.

**Keyboard defaults.**

| Action | Default binding |
| --- | --- |
| Paste from slot 1–9 | `Ctrl+Shift+1` through `Ctrl+Shift+9` |
| Paste from slot 10 | `Ctrl+Shift+0` |
| Paste from slot 11 | `Ctrl+Shift+-` |
| Paste from slot 12 | `Ctrl+Shift+=` |
| Copy to slot 1–9 | `Ctrl+Shift+Grave, Shift+1` through `Ctrl+Shift+Grave, Shift+9` |
| Copy to slot 10 | `Ctrl+Shift+Grave, Shift+0` |
| Copy to slot 11 | `Ctrl+Shift+Grave, Shift+-` |
| Copy to slot 12 | `Ctrl+Shift+Grave, Shift+=` |
| Open Copy Tray dialog | `Ctrl+Shift+Grave, X` |

The paste bindings use the number row directly for maximum speed. The copy bindings use the QUILL-key prefix to distinguish from heading shortcuts. All bindings are reassignable via the Keymap Editor.

**Storage.** `copy_tray.json` in the QUILL user data directory. Atomic write (`os.replace`). Version-tagged JSON; corrupt files fail silently (fresh state, no crash).

**Accessibility guarantees.** Every operation announces through the screen-reader bridge: "Copied to slot 1", "Pasted from slot 3 (signature)", "Slot 5 is empty", "Slot 2: by the way" (peek). The dialog list receives focus on open. Empty and non-empty slots are announced distinctly. The clear-all confirmation defaults to No.

**Implementation map.** `quill/core/copy_tray.py` (pure model, mypy-clean; `TraySlot` with `pinned` field, `pin_slot`, `unpin_slot`, `first_empty_slot`, `search_slots`), `quill/core/multi_press.py` (MultiPressDispatcher, wx-free), `quill/ui/main_frame_copy_tray.py` (mixin: multi-press wiring, `copy_to_next_slot`, `search_tray_slots`, `_TraySearchDialog`, `_update_paste_tray_labels`), `quill/ui/copy_tray_dialog.py` (dialog with Pin/Unpin button), `quill/core/keymap.py` (24 slot commands + 4 management commands). Menu: `Edit > Copy Tray` submenu including "Copy to Next Empty Slot" and "Search Tray Slots...".

### 5.78 Abbreviation Expansion — TextExpander-style bare-word shortcuts

Abbreviation Expansion replaces short trigger words with longer text automatically as you type. It complements the snippet system (which requires an explicit trigger prefix) by firing on any bare word followed by a delimiter.

**Motivation.** Typing common phrases repeatedly is fatiguing and slow. TextExpander and similar tools are widely used but require separate purchase and licensing. QUILL's built-in abbreviation engine gives screen-reader users the same productivity gain with no external dependency and full keyboard control over every setting.

**How it works.** When the user types a trigger word (e.g. `btw`) followed by any delimiter character — space, period, comma, semicolon, colon, exclamation mark, question mark, closing bracket, closing brace, tab, or newline — QUILL:

1. Detects the trigger at the cursor.
2. Looks up the trigger in the library (longest match first; case-insensitive by default).
3. Replaces the trigger with the expanded text.
4. Positions the cursor as specified (at `${cursor}` if present, otherwise after the expansion).
5. Optionally plays a configured sound.
6. Announces the expansion through the screen-reader bridge.

**Default library.** Fifteen built-in abbreviations ship out-of-the-box: `afaik` → as far as I know, `afaict` → as far as I can tell, `asap` → as soon as possible, `atm` → at the moment, `btw` → by the way, `fwiw` → for what it's worth, `imo` → in my opinion, `imho` → in my humble opinion, `irl` → in real life, `omw` → on my way, `tbh` → to be honest, `tbc` → to be confirmed, `tbd` → to be determined, `ttyl` → talk to you later, `wrt` → with regard to. These are declared as `_BUILTINS` in `abbreviations.py`.

**Variables.** Expansion bodies support:

| Variable | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `${cursor}` | Cursor position after expansion |
| `${date}` | Current date (e.g. June 11, 2026) |
| `${time}` | Current time (12-hour, e.g. 02:30 PM) |
| `${clipboard}` | System clipboard text at expansion time |

**Keyboard defaults.**

| Action | Default binding |
| --- | --- |
| Expand abbreviation at cursor (manual) | `Ctrl+Shift+Grave, A` |
| Manage Abbreviations... | `Ctrl+Shift+Grave, Shift+A` |
| Toggle expansion on/off | `Ctrl+Shift+Grave, E` |

**Settings.** Four settings in `Editing` preferences:

- `abbreviation_expansion` (bool, default True) — master on/off.
- `abbreviation_expansion_sound` (bool, default False) — play a sound on expansion.
- `abbreviation_expansion_sound_file` (text) — path to a `.wav` file; blank = system default beep.
- `multi_press_window_ms` (int, default 400, range 100–1000) — time window for double/triple press detection across all multi-press chords (copy tray peek, command palette re-run, etc.).

**Status bar.** The `abbreviations` status bar cell shows `ABR: On` or `ABR: Off`. Clicking it toggles expansion. Hidden by default; add via status bar settings.

**Storage.** `abbreviations.json` in the QUILL user data directory. Atomic write. Default library written on first launch if file is absent.

**Interaction with snippets.** Abbreviation expansion fires before snippet expansion in `_on_text_changed`. If an abbreviation match is found, snippet expansion is skipped for that keystroke. The `;`-prefix snippet trigger is disjoint from bare-word abbreviation triggers so conflicts are practically impossible.

**Accessibility guarantees.** Every expansion announces "Expanded: \<preview\>" through the screen-reader bridge. Manual trigger (`Ctrl+Shift+Grave, A`) announces "Expanded to: \<preview\>" or "No abbreviation match". Toggle announces "Abbreviation expansion on/off".

**Abbreviation Manager dialog.** `quill/ui/abbreviation_manager_dialog.py` — A11Y-4 compliant, registered in the dialog inventory. Features: search field (filters the list in real time), Import button (merges a JSON file, skips duplicate IDs, announces count), Export button (saves full library to a JSON file). Disabled abbreviations shown with "(disabled)" suffix.

**`AbbreviationLibrary` class API** (all methods on `quill/core/abbreviations.AbbreviationLibrary`):

- `add(abbr, expansion, **kwargs) -> Abbreviation` — adds a new abbreviation, generates a UUID.
- `remove(id) -> None` — removes by ID.
- `enable(id) / disable(id) -> None` — toggle without deletion.
- `update(id, **fields) -> Abbreviation` — updates one or more fields; uses `object.__setattr__` for `slots=True` dataclass.
- `all() -> list[Abbreviation]` — full library in insert order.
- `enabled_only() -> list[Abbreviation]` — only enabled entries.
- `find_by_trigger(text, case_sensitive) -> Abbreviation | None` — looks up by trigger word.

**Implementation map.** `quill/core/abbreviations.py` (pure model, mypy-clean: `Abbreviation` dataclass, `AbbreviationLibrary`, `try_expand`, `resolve_expansion`, `_BUILTINS`), `quill/ui/main_frame_abbreviations.py` (`AbbreviationsMixin`), `quill/ui/abbreviation_manager_dialog.py` (management dialog with search + import/export). Menu: `Insert > Expand Abbreviation`, `Insert > Manage Abbreviations...`, `Insert > Toggle Abbreviation Expansion`.

### 5.79 Ask AI — lightweight in-editor AI chat

Ask AI is a modal dialog that lets users send a prompt to a configured AI provider and read the response without leaving QUILL. No document text is changed; the dialog is purely informational.

**Motivation.** Screen-reader users frequently need to ask a quick question while writing — define a term, check a fact, explore a phrasing option — and switching to a browser or a separate AI client breaks flow, especially when using NVDA or JAWS where switching applications involves extra navigation. Ask AI keeps the interaction entirely within the QUILL keyboard model.

**Entry point.** `Tools > AI Assistant > Ask AI...` (`Alt+Q` default chord). The Command Palette entry is "Ask AI". The binding is user-reassignable.

**Providers.** Three providers are supported. QUILL detects which keys are configured and only shows available providers.

| Provider | Auth | Model discovery |
| --- | --- | --- |
| OpenRouter | API key (DPAPI-encrypted) | `GET /api/v1/models`, cached per session |
| OpenAI | API key (DPAPI-encrypted) | `GET /v1/models`, filtered to `gpt-*`/`o*` families |
| Ollama | None (local) | `GET /api/tags`; greyed out if service not running |

**Smart focus.** When the dialog opens, focus lands in the Prompt field if the provider and model are already configured. If not yet configured, focus starts on the Provider choice so the user is guided to set it up first.

**Dialog layout.**

```
Provider:  [OpenRouter v]
Model:     [claude-3-5-sonnet v]
Prompt:    [multiline — Ctrl+Enter to send]
[Send]  [Clear]  [Close]
```

The response opens in a separate read-only dialog (model label at top, scrollable text area, Copy to Clipboard, Close). Closing the response dialog returns focus to the Ask AI dialog so the user can ask a follow-up without reopening.

**Settings** (in `Preferences > AI`):

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ai_chat_default_provider` | str | `"openrouter"` | Last-used provider |
| `ai_chat_default_model` | str | `""` | Last-used model |
| `ollama_base_url` | str | `"http://localhost:11434"` | Ollama endpoint (override for remote Ollama) |

**Keys stored in Windows Credential Manager** (never in `settings.json`): `quill-openrouter-api-key`, `quill-openai-api-key`.

**Safe Mode.** The Ask AI menu item and dialog are disabled when `QUILL_SAFE_MODE=1`.

**Network egress.** Audited in `network_egress_audit.py`: `openrouter_chat`, `openai_chat`, `ollama_chat`, `openrouter_models`, `openai_models`, `ollama_models`. Timeout: 60 s for chat, 10 s for model list.

**Implementation map.** `quill/core/ai_chat.py` (provider abstraction: `send_prompt`, `list_models`), `quill/ui/ai_chat_dialog.py` (Ask AI dialog + AI Response dialog, A11Y-4 hardened, registered in dialog inventory).

### 5.80 Check Grammar with AI

Check Grammar with AI sends the current selection (or full document if nothing is selected) to the configured AI model with a grammar-review prompt and displays the result in the AI Response dialog. No edits are applied automatically.

**Entry point.** `Edit > Grammar > Check Grammar with AI`. Command Palette: "Check Grammar with AI". User-assignable binding; no default chord.

**Default prompt.**

```
You are a grammar and style editor. Review the following text and list
only the corrections needed. For each correction, give: the original
phrase, the corrected phrase, and a one-sentence reason. Do not rewrite
the whole passage. If the text is correct, say "No issues found."

Text:
{selection}
```

When Phase 3 (§5.81) is active, the command uses the user's "Check Grammar" prompt from the Prompt Library instead, so the instruction text is fully customisable.

**Model selection.** Uses `settings.ai_prompt_default_model` when set, otherwise falls back to `settings.ai_chat_default_model`. This lets users choose a different (e.g. more capable) model for grammar review than for casual chat.

**Implementation.** Single method `check_grammar_with_ai()` in `MainFrame`. Runs on a background thread (`threading.Thread`, daemon=True); UI updates via `wx.CallAfter`. Command id: `tools.check_grammar_ai`.

---

### 5.81 AI Prompt Library

The Prompt Library is a named, user-expandable collection of AI instructions. Each prompt operates on the current selection or document: the user picks a prompt, QUILL sends the text and the prompt to the AI, and a response dialog shows the result. No document text changes without explicit action.

**Motivation.** Power users accumulate a personal set of AI instructions they run repeatedly — improve clarity, vary sentence rhythm, convert to bullets, generate an outline. Without a library, these prompts must be retyped or pasted from an external file each time. The Prompt Library turns these into first-class named commands, accessible from the keyboard, the command palette, and the dialog.

**Entry point.** `Tools > AI Assistant > Prompt Library...`. Command Palette: "Prompt Library". User-assignable binding.

**Prompt object fields.**

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `name` | Short display name ("Improve clarity") |
| `text` | Instruction text, with `{selection}`, `{document}`, `{title}` variables |
| `category` | Editing, Writing, Structure, Research, or Custom |
| `is_builtin` | True for shipped defaults — editable but not deletable |
| `id` | UUID, stable across renames |
| `shortcut` | Optional keyboard chord bound to this prompt |
| `enabled` | False to hide from menus without deleting |
| `source` | "builtin", "user", or Quillin id |

**Built-in prompts (12).** Shipped defaults, always present, user-editable:

- Editing: Check Grammar, Improve Clarity, Fix Grammar, Make Concise, Active Voice, Formal Tone, Conversational Tone
- Writing: Continue from Here
- Structure: Convert to Bullet Points
- Research: Define This Term, Find Counterarguments
- Custom: (none shipped; user-created)

**Prompt Library Dialog.** Split layout: left panel shows a searchable list of all prompts (filtered by the search field in real time); right panel shows the selected prompt's text and an optional input override. Buttons: Run with AI, New Prompt, Edit, Disable/Enable, Delete, Import .pqp, Export .pqp, Close. A11Y-4 hardened, registered in the dialog inventory.

**Settings.**

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ai_prompt_default_model` | str | `""` | Model used for prompt runs. Blank inherits `ai_chat_default_model`. |

**Storage.** `%APPDATA%\Quill\prompts.json` — atomic write, schema-validated. Built-in prompts are not persisted; only user additions and overrides to built-ins are stored.

**Quillin bridge.** A Quillin may ship a `prompts.json` file alongside its manifest. QUILL loads it automatically when the Prompt Library opens, adding those prompts to the library for the session (not persisted to disk). The bundled `ai-writing-prompts` Quillin ships 7 additional prompts this way: Expand This, Vary Sentence Rhythm, Make More Vivid (Writing); Write a Title, Generate Outline (Structure); Suggest Supporting Evidence (Research); Plain Language (Editing).

**Implementation map.** `quill/core/prompt_library.py` (`Prompt` dataclass, `PromptLibrary` CRUD, `.pqp` import/export, Quillin prompt loading), `quill/ui/prompt_library_dialog.py` (Prompt Library dialog), `quill/quillins_bundled/ai-writing-prompts/` (bundled prompt pack).

---

### 5.82 Prompt Quill Pack (.pqp) — shareable prompt collections

A `.pqp` (Prompt Quill Pack) file is a JSON document that packages a named collection of prompts for sharing or backup.

**File format.**

```json
{
  "schema": "quill.prompt-pack/1",
  "name": "My Writing Prompts",
  "prompts": [
    {
      "name": "Make Punchy",
      "text": "Rewrite this as a punchy one-liner: {selection}",
      "category": "Editing"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Import.** Via the Import .pqp button in the Prompt Library dialog. Prompts whose name already exists in the library are skipped; the count of newly added prompts is announced.

**Export.** Via the Export .pqp button. Exports all user-defined prompts (or a selected subset). Built-in prompts can optionally be included when the user has edited them.

**Use case.** A writing team can share a `.pqp` file containing their house-style prompts. A power user can back up their library and restore it on a new machine. A Quillin author can distribute prompts as a `.pqp` for users who prefer not to install a Quillin.

---

### 5.83 Quillin Manager — install, update, and remove extensions

The Quillin Manager (`Tools > Quillins`) lets users discover, enable, disable, and uninstall Quillins. As of this version it also supports installing a new Quillin directly from a local folder.

**Install from Folder.** The Install from Folder button opens a system folder picker. QUILL reads the selected folder's `manifest.json`, validates it, copies the directory into the per-user extensions root (`%APPDATA%\Quill\extensions\<id>\`), enables the Quillin, and refreshes the list. If an extension with the same id is already installed, it is replaced. Path containment is enforced: a crafted extension id cannot install files outside the extensions root.

**Remove.** Selecting an extension and pressing Remove deletes its directory and removes its state entry. Confirmation is required.

**Enable/Disable.** Toggle without uninstalling. A disabled Quillin's prompts and commands are not loaded.

**Manifest display.** Selecting a Quillin shows its name, version, author, description, declared capabilities, and any validation errors. This gives users the information they need to make an informed trust decision before enabling.

**Security model (SEC-8).** Third-party Quillin *discovery* (auto-scanning the extensions root) is locked off for QUILL 1.0 (`core.third_party_plugins` feature flag is `locked_off`). Install from Folder is the only way to add a third-party Quillin. The user must explicitly choose the folder, providing informed consent equivalent to "install this extension". Bundled Quillins (shipped inside the QUILL install tree) are always discovered and are not affected by the SEC-8 lock.

**Implementation map.** `quill/core/quillins/loader.py` (`install_extension`, `remove_extension`, `set_enabled`), `quill/ui/main_frame_quillins.py` (`QuillinsManagerMixin` — manager panel, Install from Folder button and handler).

### 5.84 Skill Quill Pack (.sqp) — multi-step AI workflows in plain text

A `.sqp` (Skill Quill Pack) file is a Markdown document with YAML front matter where level-1 headings define sequential AI steps. It extends `.pqp` prompt packs from single instructions to multi-step workflows with parameters, variable chaining, and conditional branching.

**Motivation.** Many real AI tasks are not single-shot prompts. Research then draft. Analyse then rewrite. Detect intent then branch. Encoding this logic in JSON means writing a DSL nobody can author without tooling. Writing it in Markdown means any user can open the file, read every step, and edit it — no schema browser, no visual designer. The skill is the document.

**Key design choices:**
- No streaming — each step sends a full prompt and receives a full response before the next step runs. This makes step outputs reliable as inputs to subsequent steps.
- Synchronous execution from the caller's perspective; threading is the UI layer's responsibility.
- Depth limit of 2 for nested skill calls to keep execution predictable.

**File format (`quill.skill/1`).**

```markdown
---
schema: quill.skill/1
name: Research and Draft
description: Extracts topic, gathers facts, drafts a paragraph.
author: QUILL Project
version: 1.0.0
parameters:
  - name: tone
    label: Tone
    type: choice
    choices: [formal, conversational, neutral]
    default: neutral
---

# Step 1: Extract topic

Identify the main topic in: {selection}

# Step 2: Research

List five facts about "{step1.output}".

# Step 3: Draft

Write a {parameters.tone} paragraph weaving in those facts.
Facts: {step2.output}

```output
format: text
label: Drafted paragraph
accept_into: selection
```
```

**Special blocks inside steps:**

| Block type | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `` `input` `` | Appends literal data to the prompt text |
| `` `condition` `` | Branches execution: `if: "X" contains "Y" / then: step3 / else: step4` |
| `` `output` `` | On last step: `format` (text/list/json), `label`, `accept_into` (selection/clipboard/none) |
| `` `use-prompt` `` | Delegates to a named prompt from the Prompt Library |
| `` `use-skill` `` | Calls another skill (depth-bounded) |

**Variables.** `{selection}`, `{document}`, `{title}`, `{clipboard}`, `{stepN.output}`, `{parameters.name}`.

**Validation tool.** `python -m quill.tools.sqp_validator <path>` validates one file or a directory. Exit 0 clean, exit 1 errors, `--strict` also checks for missing metadata.

**Bundled skills.** The `ai-writing-skills` Quillin ships four sample skills: Accessible Rewrite, Research and Draft, Meeting Notes to Action Items, Argument Strengthener.

**Implementation map.**

| File | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `quill/core/skill_pack.py` | `SkillPack` dataclass, `.sqp` parser, validator, synchronous runner |
| `quill/tools/sqp_validator.py` | CLI validator |
| `quill/quillins_bundled/ai-writing-skills/` | Four bundled `.sqp` skill files |
| `tests/unit/core/test_skill_pack.py` | 23 tests: parsing, validation, runner, branching, bundled files |

---

### 5.85 Portable API key store

By default QUILL stores AI provider keys in the Windows Credential Manager, which ties them to the current Windows user account. Portable mode offers an alternative: a DPAPI-encrypted file (`keys.enc`) in the QUILL data directory, activated by setting `QUILL_PORTABLE=1`.

**Motivation.** Some users run QUILL from a self-contained folder on a network share or external drive. They want all QUILL data — settings, data files, and keys — to live in one directory without requiring Credential Manager access on each machine. A DPAPI-encrypted file achieves this: everything stays in the folder, and the file is protected by the Windows user-account key.

**Access priority chain (highest wins):**

1. Environment variable (`QUILL_OPENROUTER_KEY`, `QUILL_OPENAI_KEY`, `QUILL_OLLAMA_KEY`, `QUILL_ASSISTANT_KEY`) — for CI pipelines and developer overrides.
2. Portable file store (`keys.enc`) — when `QUILL_PORTABLE=1` is set.
3. Windows Credential Manager — default for standard installations.

**Activation.** Set `QUILL_PORTABLE=1` in the process environment before launching QUILL. No other configuration is needed. The `keys.enc` file is created automatically in `app_data_dir()` on first key save.

**Security properties.** The file is encrypted with Windows DPAPI using a QUILL-specific entropy token. It is decryptable only on the same Windows machine by the same user account that encrypted it. Moving `keys.enc` to a different machine or a different Windows account will fail to decrypt; the user must re-enter their keys.

**Implementation map.**

| File | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `quill/platform/windows/credential_store.py` | Unified load/save/delete with env-var, portable file, and Credential Manager backends |
| `quill/platform/windows/dpapi.py` | DPAPI `protect_secret`/`unprotect_secret` (existing) |
| `quill/ui/ai_chat_dialog.py` | `_load_api_key`/`_save_api_key` updated to use credential_store |
| `quill/core/assistant_ai.py` | `_load/save/delete_api_key_from_credential_manager` updated to use credential_store |

## 6. Spell checking deep dive

### 6.1 The TinySpell question

TinySpell is a small, fast Windows spell-checker that watches the clipboard or current input field and alerts on misspellings. It is genuinely useful for many users. So the question is: should Quill integrate tightly with TinySpell, or build its own engine?

We have chosen to **build our own engine**, tightly integrated into Quill, for the following reasons:

1. **Screen-reader fidelity.** TinySpell speaks through its own UI surfaces and conventions. Quill needs total control over how misspellings are announced, navigated, and corrected so that NVDA, JAWS, and Narrator hear the same predictable patterns. A loose integration would create a second source of speech that competes with our own.
2. **Document context.** TinySpell works across applications and therefore cannot use document-level context (heading structure, surrounding paragraph, language metadata, per-document dictionary). Quill knows exactly what document the cursor is in and can do much better.
3. **Per-document and per-paragraph language detection.** Multi-language documents need language switches mid-stream. An external tool will not know.
4. **Suggestion ranking that learns.** TinySpell's suggestion order is fixed. Quill ranks suggestions using the user's own writing and the surrounding sentence, which is the single biggest quality-of-life upgrade in modern spell check.
5. **Offline guarantee.** Quill commits to spell check working with zero network. An external dependency complicates that guarantee.
6. **Distribution.** Bundling TinySpell would create a licence and update story we do not control.
7. **Keymap and palette parity.** Every Quill action is in the palette and reassignable. Spell-check commands must be too.

We will, however, ship a small **TinySpell interop plugin** for v1.1 for users who already rely on TinySpell elsewhere and want a unified personal dictionary. That plugin imports/exports the personal dictionary file and otherwise stays out of the way.

### 6.2 Engine architecture: "Quill Spell"

Quill Spell is a layered local engine:

- **Layer 1: Tokeniser.** Unicode-aware word splitter that understands code (CamelCase, snake_case, kebab-case), contractions, hyphenation, URLs, emoji, file paths, and Markdown/HTML syntax tokens. It hands the next layer a stream of `(word, span, context_kind)` tuples where `context_kind` is one of `prose`, `code`, `identifier`, `url`, `markup`, `path`.
- **Layer 2: Dictionary stack.** A priority-ordered stack of dictionaries: per-document, per-project (if applicable), user personal, language-base (Hunspell), plus optional jargon packs (medical, legal, technical, scientific). The first dictionary that accepts the word wins.
- **Layer 3: Hunspell backend.** Bundled via `cyhunspell`. Dictionaries shipped: en-US, en-GB, en-CA, en-AU, es-ES, es-MX, fr-FR, de-DE, pt-BR, pl-PL, ja-JP (with MeCab). Others available via a one-click downloader.
- **Layer 4: Suggestion engine.** Combines Hunspell's edit-distance suggestions with a character-level n-gram model and a small contextual reranker (a tiny on-device transformer; runs on CPU in <10 ms per call). Top 5 suggestions, ranked by combined score.
- **Layer 5: Learning loop.** When the user accepts a suggestion, the engine increments its frequency. When the user adds a word, it goes to the appropriate dictionary (with a prompt asking which). When the user repeatedly rejects a suggestion in favour of another, the reranker learns the preference. Learning is 100 percent local and resettable.
- **Layer 6: Context awareness.** The tokeniser tells the engine when it is inside a code fence, an inline code span, a URL, or a Markdown link target. Those regions are skipped by default. Settings let the user enable code spell checking with a programming-aware dictionary.

### 6.3 User experience

- **Status indicator.** The status bar shows the active dictionary stack as a short label, for example `en-GB + tech + personal`.
- **F7 full review.** Modal Spell Check dialog with: misspelled word, surrounding sentence with the word highlighted and announced, suggestions list, replacement edit, Change, Change All, Ignore, Ignore All, Add to (with submenu for which dictionary), Finish, Cancel. The word is spoken and then spelled letter by letter.
- **Ctrl+; quick fix.** Jumps to the next misspelling, opens a small modal list of the top 5 suggestions. Numbers 1 through 5 accept the corresponding suggestion. Enter accepts the highlighted one. `A` adds to dictionary. `I` ignores once. `Esc` cancels.
- **Background pass.** A debounced background tokenise runs as the user types. Results live in a sidecar model. No visual squiggles. The screen reader is never interrupted by background work.
- **Mode toggle.** `Alt+F7` toggles as-you-type checking for the current document.
- **Per-document language.** A YAML-style sidecar (`<doc>.quill.yml`) can pin language and dictionaries. Detected automatically from a magic comment on the first line if present.
- **Magic touches.**
  - When you add a word, Quill says "Added <word> to your personal dictionary" or "Added <word> to this document's dictionary" so you always know where it went.
  - When you reject the same suggestion three times for the same misspelling, Quill quietly asks once whether you want to add the rejected word to your personal dictionary.
  - When pasting a large block of text, the spell pass is queued at a lower priority so the paste itself is instant.
  - When entering a code fence in Markdown, the engine switches automatically to identifier mode and stops complaining about variable names.

---

## 7. Command palette deep dive

The command palette is modelled directly on Visual Studio Code's, adapted for screen readers.

### 7.1 Opening and dismissing

- `Ctrl+Shift+P` opens the palette in command mode.
- `F1` does the same.
- Each prefix shortcut (below) opens the palette pre-seeded with that prefix.
- `Esc` closes without action.
- `Enter` runs the selected entry (and remembers it).
- `Tab` from the input moves into the list. `Shift+Tab` returns to the input.

### 7.2 Prefix modes

A single edit field, one list. The first character of the input may be a mode prefix:

| Prefix | Shortcut to open directly | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| (none) or `>` | `Ctrl+Shift+P` | Run a command |
| `?` | `Ctrl+Shift+?` | Show help for all prefixes |
| `:` | `Ctrl+G` (when no page markers) | Go to line |
| `@` | `Ctrl+R` | Jump to bookmark in current document |
| `#` | `Ctrl+T` | Jump to bookmark across all open documents |
| `!` | `Ctrl+Shift+M` | Show issues (spell check, bookmark, format) |
| `<` | `Ctrl+E` | Open a recent file |
| `~` | `Ctrl+Shift+O` | Switch open document |
| `=` | (palette only) | Open a setting |

These prefixes are themselves reassignable (see [section 8](#8-keymap-and-keystroke-reassignment)).

### 7.3 Matching

- Fuzzy subsequence match across the visible label.
- Each match scored by: subsequence tightness, prefix bonus, word-boundary bonus, recency, frequency.
- Top 100 results displayed, lazily.
- Ties broken alphabetically.

### 7.4 Rows

Each row in command mode shows three regions, all announced as one string by the screen reader (with internal punctuation chosen to read well):

```text
<Command title> — <current keybinding or "unassigned"> — <source>
```

For example:

```text
Improve Reading Order with AI — unassigned — Quill
Spell Check Document — F7 — Quill
Find Next — F3 — Quill
Pandoc: Convert to DOCX — Ctrl+Alt+P — Plugin: Pandoc Bridge
```

### 7.5 Inline keybinding edit

While the palette is open and a command is highlighted:

- `Right Arrow` enters keybinding edit mode for that command.
- A small inline edit prompt says "Press the new shortcut, or Escape to cancel, or Delete to unassign."
- The next keystroke (chord or sequence) becomes the binding.
- Conflicts are detected immediately and announced (see [section 8.4](#84-conflict-handling)).
- `Enter` commits, `Esc` cancels.

### 7.6 Recently used and pinned

- The most recently run 10 commands always appear at the top when the palette opens fresh, before any typing.
- Users can pin commands with `Shift+Enter` from the palette. Pinned commands always appear above recents.

### 7.7 Help

- `?` plus Enter, or `Ctrl+Shift+?`, shows a "How to use the Command Palette" topic in the palette itself: a list of prefixes, their meanings, and their shortcuts, each line runnable with Enter to invoke an example.
- Where Am I (`Ctrl+Shift+I`) in the palette announces: current mode, number of matches, selected entry, current binding.

### 7.8 Accessibility specifics

- The palette is a non-modal top-level `wx.Frame` over the main window with focus capture. Underlying widgets are a `wx.SearchCtrl` and a `wx.ListBox`. Both are stock controls, so all screen readers get correct announcements without scripts.
- Each list update fires a single accessibility event with the count of results; we do not spam announcements as the user types.
- Live region is set on the help/result line below the list for status messages such as "Keybinding updated" and "Conflict with Find Next."

---

## 8. Keymap and keystroke reassignment

Every Quill action is identified by a stable command id (`quill.editor.save`, `quill.palette.open`, `quill.spell.checkDocument`, etc.) and may have zero, one, or many keybindings.

### 8.1 Where keystrokes live

Three layers, in priority order:

1. **User keymap** (`%APPDATA%\Quill\keymap.json`). User edits win.
2. **Profile keymap** (optional, shipped alternatives). For example, "Word-like", "Vim-friendly", "Emacs-friendly". The user picks one as the base.
3. **Default keymap** (built into Quill).

The effective keymap is the merge of these three, with user > profile > default.

### 8.2 Keyboard settings page

`Ctrl+,` then "Keyboard" (or palette `=keyboard`).

The page contains:

- A **profile selector**: System (defaults), Word-like, Vim-friendly, Emacs-friendly, Custom.
- A **search field** that filters the table below.
- A **bindings table** (`wx.ListCtrl` in report mode, fully accessible) with columns:
  - Command title
  - When (context: editor, palette, dialog, global)
  - Keybinding
  - Source (default, profile, user)
  - Conflicts (a short marker if any)
- **Buttons**: Add, Change, Remove, Reset to default, Reset all to profile, Import, Export.
- A **"Press a key" capture field** for visual users who want to find what a chord does today.

### 8.3 Editing a single binding

Three equivalent ways:

1. From the command palette: highlight a command and press `Right Arrow`.
2. From the Keyboard settings page: select the row and press `Change` (or `Enter`).
3. From the menu bar: every menu item has a context-menu entry "Change keybinding".

In all three, the same small "Press the new shortcut" capture dialog appears. It:

- Captures any chord or two-key sequence (VS Code style, e.g. `Ctrl+K Ctrl+S`).
- Announces the captured keystroke as it is built.
- Refuses to capture purely modifier keys.
- Refuses to capture keystrokes reserved by the OS or by the active screen reader (NVDA, JAWS, Narrator) and explains which one it conflicts with.

### 8.4 Conflict handling

When a keystroke is already used:

- The dialog announces the conflict: "Ctrl+G is currently used by Go To Line in editor context."
- Three choices, each on its own button: **Replace** (the old command becomes unbound and the new one is bound), **Add** (both commands have this binding; the active "when" context disambiguates), **Cancel**.
- "Add" is only offered when contexts are distinct. Same-context dual binding is not allowed for safety.

### 8.5 "When" contexts

Each command declares which contexts it is valid in:

- `editor` — focus is in the main editor.
- `palette` — focus is in the command palette.
- `dialog` — focus is in any Quill dialog.
- `global` — anywhere in the app.
- `format:md` — editor focus, current document is Markdown.
- `format:pdf` — editor focus, current document was extracted from PDF.
- `selection` — there is a non-empty selection.

Contexts can be combined with `&&` in advanced editing.

### 8.6 Profiles in detail

- **System**: clean, modern Windows conventions (default).
- **Word-like**: brings Quill close to Microsoft Word for users migrating from there.
- **Vim-friendly**: a modal layer overlaid via plugin, off by default in the profile selector but available to install.
- **Emacs-friendly**: chord-heavy bindings (`Ctrl+X Ctrl+S` etc.), again via the chord engine.

### 8.7 Storage format

`keymap.json` is plain JSON, human readable, version controlled friendly:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "profile": "System",
  "bindings": [
    { "command": "quill.editor.save", "key": "Ctrl+S", "when": "editor" },
    { "command": "quill.palette.open", "key": "Ctrl+Shift+P", "when": "global" },
    { "command": "quill.spell.checkDocument", "key": "F7", "when": "editor" },
    { "command": "quill.editor.gotoLine", "key": "Ctrl+G", "when": "editor && !format:pdf" }
  ]
}
```

### 8.8 Import, export, sync

- Export the active keymap to a single JSON file.
- Import from a file (with a preview dialog showing every change).
- Sync via a user-chosen folder (OneDrive, Dropbox, Syncthing). Quill watches the file and reloads on change, announcing "Keymap reloaded from disk."

### 8.9 Safety net

- A "Reset all keybindings" button exists at the bottom of the Keyboard settings page.
- Recovery: if `keymap.json` is corrupt, Quill renames it to `keymap.broken-<timestamp>.json` and falls back to defaults, announcing what happened.

## 9. Accessibility, WCAG 2.2 AA conformance, and certification

Accessibility is not a feature set; it is the product's contract with its users. This section is the canonical reference for what "accessible" means for Quill, how it is engineered, how it is tested, how regressions are caught, and how a Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT) Accessibility Conformance Report (ACR) is generated for procurement.

### 9.1 Compliance posture and target standards

Quill targets the following standards in full at v1.0 release:

- **WCAG 2.2 Level AA** (W3C Recommendation, October 2023). All Level A and AA Success Criteria that apply to a native desktop application are conformed to.
- **WCAG 2.2 Level AAA** for criteria reasonably achievable in a text editor (contrast 7:1 in High Contrast theme; reading-level alternatives; consistent help).
- **US Section 508** (revised 2018 ICT Refresh, which incorporates WCAG 2.0 AA). Conformance is established by demonstrating WCAG 2.2 AA conformance, which is a superset.
- **EN 301 549 v3.2.1** (European harmonised standard, including chapters 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, and 12 as applicable).
- **ARIA 1.2 / WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices** patterns are honoured wherever Quill exposes ARIA-equivalent semantics through MSAA/UIA (combobox patterns for the palette, treeview patterns for the Outline Navigator, listbox patterns for issue panels).
- **Microsoft's Accessibility Insights for Windows** baseline (every CI build is run through Accessibility Insights and must produce zero errors and zero warnings on covered axes).

**Screen-reader coverage across platforms.** On Windows, Quill targets **NVDA (primary), JAWS, and Narrator**; on **macOS** it targets **VoiceOver**. Quill routes its own announcements to the active platform screen reader and never speaks over it (on macOS it defers to VoiceOver rather than falling back to a separate speech engine). Embedded web content -- the Ask Quill chat, the Markdown/HTML preview, the About box, and the update/consent dialogs -- is driven through semantic HTML/ARIA so it reads as a real web document under NVDA, JAWS, and VoiceOver alike (see the accessible-WebView approach in section 10).

### 9.2 Conformance posture statement (will appear in the ACR)

> Quill 1.0 **supports** WCAG 2.2 Level A and Level AA across all functionality intended for end users. It **partially supports** Level AAA criteria 1.4.6 (Contrast Enhanced) and 2.4.10 (Section Headings). Quill does not include audio-only or video-only media; criteria specific to such media are **not applicable**.

### 9.3 WCAG 2.2 AA conformance matrix

The following matrix lists every Level A and AA Success Criterion, how Quill meets it, and where it is tested. Each row is a contract: a CI test exists for every “Tested by” entry, and a regression fails the build.

#### Principle 1: Perceivable

| SC | Title | Level | How Quill meets it | Tested by |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1.1.1 | Non-text Content | A | Every icon-bearing button has a `wx.Window.SetName`/`SetHelpText` pair; the Accessibility Auditor (5.20) requires alt text on every image in user documents | UI a11y harness; auditor unit tests |
| 1.2.x | Time-based Media | A/AA | Not applicable; Quill ships no audio/video | n/a |
| 1.3.1 | Info and Relationships | A | Every label is associated with its control via parent-sizer convention plus explicit `SetLabel`; menu structure is exposed as MSAA tree; status-bar cells expose name+role+value+description | UI a11y harness verifies MSAA tree; snapshot tests |
| 1.3.2 | Meaningful Sequence | A | Tab order is explicit and deterministic per dialog; tested with `pywinauto` walking each dialog | Tab-order snapshot tests |
| 1.3.3 | Sensory Characteristics | A | No instruction uses shape, position, sound, or colour alone; all hints are text in tooltips and Where Am I | Manual checklist; copy review |
| 1.3.4 | Orientation | AA | Window orientation is user-controlled; no orientation lock | n/a (desktop) |
| 1.3.5 | Identify Input Purpose | AA | Settings fields use semantic `name` attributes mappable to autofill purposes where the OS supports them | Settings inventory |
| 1.4.1 | Use of Colour | A | Modified state is text (`[modified]`), not colour; issue severity uses prefix words (`Error:`, `Warning:`); diff hunks use `+`/`-` prefixes | Theme tests; copy review |
| 1.4.2 | Audio Control | A | Read Aloud has explicit start/pause/stop and a status cell; can be silenced at any time without affecting the SR | Manual + UI test |
| 1.4.3 | Contrast (Minimum) | AA | All bundled themes meet 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text and UI components; verified by an automated contrast checker run against every theme | Contrast CI job |
| 1.4.4 | Resize Text | AA | Editor font 10–48pt via `Ctrl++`/`Ctrl+-`/`Ctrl+0`; dialog text scales with Windows DPI (100–400%) without loss of function or clipping | DPI smoke tests at 100/125/150/175/200/300/400 |
| 1.4.5 | Images of Text | AA | Quill never renders text as an image; all UI text is real text in stock controls | n/a |
| 1.4.10 | Reflow | AA | Window contents reflow to 320 CSS px equivalent (320 device-independent pixels); status-bar cells overflow into a roll-up; menu falls back to compact mode | Reflow tests at minimum window size |
| 1.4.11 | Non-text Contrast | AA | All UI components and graphical objects (focus rings, status-bar separators, toggle states) meet 3:1 against adjacent colours | Contrast CI job covers component states |
| 1.4.12 | Text Spacing | AA | Editor honours user spacing overrides (line height up to 1.5x, paragraph spacing up to 2x font size, letter spacing up to 0.12em, word spacing up to 0.16em) without truncation or overlap | Spacing test fixture |
| 1.4.13 | Content on Hover or Focus | AA | Tooltips are dismissible (Esc), hoverable, and persist until input moves away | Hover tests |

#### Principle 2: Operable

| SC | Title | Level | How Quill meets it | Tested by |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2.1.1 | Keyboard | A | Every action is reachable from the keyboard; drag-and-drop is explicitly omitted from required flows | Keyboard parity matrix test |
| 2.1.2 | No Keyboard Trap | A | Every dialog has an Escape route; F6 cycles regions; modal dialogs have an explicit Cancel | Trap detection in pywinauto suite |
| 2.1.4 | Character Key Shortcuts | A | Single-character shortcuts (like F3) are bound only to commands that re-fire safely; users can rebind all of them; no single-letter shortcuts in editor focus | Keymap audit |
| 2.2.1 | Timing Adjustable | A | The only time-bound interaction is read-aloud, which the user controls; no idle timeouts in v1.0 | Manual review |
| 2.2.2 | Pause, Stop, Hide | A | Read Aloud has Pause/Stop; the only moving thing in the UI is a progress indicator that the user can cancel | Manual review |
| 2.3.1 | Three Flashes or Below Threshold | A | Quill has no flashing UI | n/a |
| 2.4.1 | Bypass Blocks | A | F6 region cycling, command palette, outline navigator | Navigation tests |
| 2.4.2 | Page Titled | A | Window title always identifies the active document and Quill | Title test |
| 2.4.3 | Focus Order | A | Focus order matches reading order; no surprise focus jumps; recent locations history surfaces movement | Tab-order snapshot tests |
| 2.4.4 | Link Purpose (In Context) | A | Insert Link dialog enforces meaningful display text; auditor flags generic link text | Auditor tests |
| 2.4.5 | Multiple Ways | AA | Outline Navigator, command palette `@`/`#`/`<`/`~`, Find, menu Navigate submenu | Navigation tests |
| 2.4.6 | Headings and Labels | AA | Settings tree and dialog sections use descriptive headings; auditor requires the same in user docs | Copy review; auditor tests |
| 2.4.7 | Focus Visible | AA | Native Windows focus indicators are preserved (no custom drawn focus); High Contrast theme amplifies the system focus ring | Focus visibility audit |
| 2.4.11 | Focus Not Obscured (Minimum) | AA (new in 2.2) | Quill does not float overlays that obscure focus; the palette and modal dialogs receive focus and are larger than the focused control | Focus-not-obscured check |
| 2.4.12 | Focus Not Obscured (Enhanced) | AAA | Same as 2.4.11; Quill conforms by construction | (auto) |
| 2.4.13 | Focus Appearance | AAA | Native Windows focus ring is honoured; High Contrast theme exceeds the 2px solid / 3:1 contrast target by relying on the OS focus rectangle | Manual verification |
| 2.5.1 | Pointer Gestures | A | No multi-point or path-based gestures required | n/a |
| 2.5.2 | Pointer Cancellation | A | Buttons activate on up-event; cancel by moving off before release | Native button behaviour |
| 2.5.3 | Label in Name | A | Accessible name begins with visible label text for every control | UI a11y harness |
| 2.5.4 | Motion Actuation | A | No motion-actuated functions | n/a |
| 2.5.7 | Dragging Movements | AA (new in 2.2) | No required drag; every drag-equivalent action has a keyboard alternative | Keyboard parity matrix |
| 2.5.8 | Target Size (Minimum) | AA (new in 2.2) | All clickable targets at least 24x24 CSS px including status-bar cells; verified per-theme | Layout tests |

#### Principle 3: Understandable

| SC | Title | Level | How Quill meets it | Tested by |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 3.1.1 | Language of Page | A | The application's UI language is declared via `wx.Locale` and exposed to MSAA | Locale tests |
| 3.1.2 | Language of Parts | AA | Per-document language metadata (5.38) and the spell-check language stack indicator (5.1b) expose document language to user and AT | Metadata tests |
| 3.2.1 | On Focus | A | Focus changes never trigger unexpected context changes | Focus tests |
| 3.2.2 | On Input | A | Form inputs require explicit confirmation; no auto-submit on change | Form tests |
| 3.2.3 | Consistent Navigation | AA | Menu structure, palette prefixes, and status-bar layout are identical across every document and dialog | Snapshot tests |
| 3.2.4 | Consistent Identification | AA | The same icon and label is used for the same action everywhere | Inventory test |
| 3.2.6 | Consistent Help | A (new in 2.2) | Help menu position and Help item names are identical across every window | Snapshot tests |
| 3.3.1 | Error Identification | A | Every error message names the field and the rule violated; never just a code | Error message inventory |
| 3.3.2 | Labels or Instructions | A | Every input has a visible label; complex fields include placeholder hints that are also exposed as MSAA description | Label inventory |
| 3.3.3 | Error Suggestion | AA | Field errors include the value the user typed and a concrete fix suggestion | Error message inventory |
| 3.3.4 | Error Prevention (Legal, Financial, Data) | AA | Destructive operations (Replace All > 25 occurrences, Restore Backup, Reset Settings) always show a confirmation; backups exist for restores | Confirmation matrix test |
| 3.3.7 | Redundant Entry | A (new in 2.2) | Previously entered values (search history, recent files, settings) are available without re-entry | Persistence tests |
| 3.3.8 | Accessible Authentication (Minimum) | AA (new in 2.2) | The only authentication is the AI provider API key, which is paste-and-store via DPAPI; no cognitive-test puzzle | n/a |

#### Principle 4: Robust

| SC | Title | Level | How Quill meets it | Tested by |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 4.1.1 | Parsing | A (obsolete in 2.2) | (Marked obsolete; included for completeness.) | n/a |
| 4.1.2 | Name, Role, Value | A | Every control exposes name, role, value, state, and where applicable description via MSAA and UIA. Custom status-bar cells implement this explicitly via `wx.Accessible` subclasses | UI a11y harness (Inspect.exe parity) |
| 4.1.3 | Status Messages | AA | All asynchronous announcements (saved, replaced N, found on line N, AI progress) are sent via the live-region pattern and through the SR-agnostic announcement channel (9.6) | Live region tests |

### 9.4 Screen-reader compatibility matrix

| Reader | Versions covered | Quill support level | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| NVDA | 2024.x, 2025.x, 2026.x stable + current beta | First-class (reference platform) | All flows fully announced; no required scripts |
| JAWS | 2024, 2025, 2026 latest | First-class | Small optional script provides live-region parity for non-standard status-bar cell updates; ships in the installer |
| Narrator | Windows 11 24H2 and later | First-class | Uses UIA path; covered by the standard MSAA wiring |
| Windows Magnifier | Current | Supported | Focus following works because of stock controls |
| ZoomText / Fusion | Current | Supported | Tested but not officially certified at v1.0 |
| Dolphin SuperNova | Current | Best effort | Tested at major releases; defects escalated |

### 9.5 Screen-reader announcement architecture

Quill speaks to the user through three independent channels, all of which deliver the same content. This is what "never goes quiet when you needed it to speak" means in code.

1. **Stock control announcements** — wx widgets carry their own MSAA/UIA semantics; the SR speaks them automatically on focus and value change.
2. **Live region channel** — a hidden `wx.StaticText` per top-level window acts as an ARIA-like live region. Quill sets its text, fires an MSAA `EVENT_OBJECT_LIVEREGIONCHANGED` and a UIA `Notification` event with kind `Other` and priority `Standard` or `High` as appropriate. NVDA and Narrator pick this up natively; JAWS reads it through the bundled optional script.
3. **Direct SR APIs (graceful degradation)** — when a detected SR is running, Quill may use its direct API for higher-priority announcements (NVDA's `nvdaControllerClient.dll` `nvdaController_speakText`, JAWS' `jfwapi.dll` `JFWSayString`, Narrator via UIA notification). This is used only when the live region path is too slow for time-sensitive feedback (find result during F3 chaining, spell-check next misspelling). The direct call is preferred only when (a) a registered SR is detected and (b) the user has not opted out in Settings → Reading.

All three channels are funnelled through a single `quill.a11y.announce(text, *, priority='normal', interruptible=True)` function, so there is exactly one code path to test.

Quill exposes an explicit announcement backend selector in Settings and command surfaces. Supported modes are `auto`, `legacy`, `prism`, and `sounds`, with `auto` as default. `auto` chooses the best backend for the current screen-reader/runtime context and falls back deterministically when a backend is unavailable.

### 9.5.1 Announcement backend provenance

The `prism` backend in Quill is derived from the architecture and behavior patterns published in the open-source Prism project:

- Source: <https://github.com/ethindp/prism>
- Scope borrowed: screen-reader announcement abstraction approach, backend-oriented dispatch model, and parity-focused announcement reliability goals.
- Quill adaptation: integrated into Quill's existing `quill.a11y.announce(...)` funnel and profile/feature controls, while preserving Quill's own command, diagnostics, and privacy conventions.

### 9.6 Keyboard accessibility gates

- **Keyboard parity matrix**: every menu item, every status-bar cell, every palette command, every dialog button has a keyboard equivalent. CI generates the matrix from the command registry and fails the build if any entry lacks an accessible keystroke.
- **No keyboard traps**: pytest-pywinauto test traverses every modal and non-modal window and asserts that Escape, Tab, and Shift+Tab always exit or cycle.
- **Single-character shortcut policy**: single-character shortcuts (F3, F7, etc.) are only bound to commands marked `repeatable`. Editor focus never binds a single printable character because that would steal typing.
- **Two-key chord policy**: the default keymap uses at most six two-key chords; profiles can use more; the user can rebind all.
- **Screen-reader chord guard** (5.8.4): when the user captures a new keystroke, Quill checks it against a curated static list of well-known NVDA, JAWS, and Narrator chords and refuses the capture with an explanation.

### 9.7 Visual accessibility gates

- **Themes**: System (follows Windows), Light, Dark, High Contrast (follows Windows High Contrast tokens), Custom (user-defined token map).
- **Contrast**: every theme is verified by an automated contrast checker (`a11y/contrast.py` using the WCAG relative-luminance formula) against every text/background and component-state pair; build fails on any pair below 4.5:1 text or 3:1 component.
- **Font scaling**: editor font 10–48pt; dialog text follows Windows DPI; all layouts tested at 100%, 125%, 150%, 175%, 200%, 300%, 400%.
- **Reflow**: minimum supported window size 800x600; all dialogs scrollable at that size; status-bar cells overflow into the roll-up cell.
- **Motion**: respects Windows “Show animations” setting; no animations in any case; progress indicators use a determinate or simple textual percentage.
- **Focus visibility**: native Windows focus rectangle is preserved; High Contrast theme amplifies; no custom-drawn focus.
- **Cursor**: caret blink rate respects Windows; thickness respects Windows; no custom carets.
- **Spacing**: 1.4.12 user overrides honoured (see matrix).
- **Target size**: every clickable target ≥ 24x24 device-independent pixels; status-bar cells ≥ 28x24.

### 9.8 Cognitive accessibility gates

- **Consistent vocabulary**: a controlled vocabulary document drives every string (e.g. "document" not "file" or "buffer"; "selection" not "highlight"); enforced by a linter over translation source files.
- **Plain-language baseline**: UI strings target a Flesch reading ease of 60 or higher; Tools (the Document Statistics engine) is used in CI to grade the UI string corpus.
- **Confirmations on destructive actions**: every destructive action prompts; default button is the safe option (Cancel, Keep Mine, etc.); the destructive button is never the default.
- **Undo for everything possible**: every editor mutation is undoable; settings and keymap changes support “Undo last change” for 30 seconds via a Notifications-cell message.
- **One-key escape**: Esc closes any palette or dialog without side effects.
- **Tooltips with intent, not jargon**: every button tooltip names the action and the result, not the implementation.
- **No autoplay**: no audio, video, or animation starts without explicit user action.

### 9.9 Accessibility testing pipeline

Three layers run on every PR and every release branch.

1. **Static / lint layer (every PR)**
   - Controlled-vocabulary linter over `*.po` translation sources.
   - Plain-language linter (Flesch ≥ 60) over UI strings.
   - Keymap audit (no editor-focus single printable letters; all commands have ids).
   - Theme contrast checker.
   - Tab-order snapshot diff (changes require an explicit reviewer approval).
   - Command registry coverage (every command has a name, description, default keybinding or explicit `unbound`, and a help topic).
2. **Headless UI layer (every PR, runs on a Windows runner)**
   - `pytest` + `pywinauto` boots the app and walks every dialog, modal, and palette mode.
   - Inspect.exe parity: a custom UIA dumper records the tree for each window; the dump is diffed against a golden snapshot.
   - Accessibility Insights for Windows CLI is run; build fails on any error.
   - DPI smoke tests at 100/150/200%.
3. **SR-in-the-loop layer (every release branch and nightly)**
   - A custom SAPI 5 speech driver records every utterance into a transcript file.
   - NVDA is launched with the recording driver via NVDA's command-line; Quill is driven through a scripted scenario set (open, find, F3 chain, palette, outline jump, spell check fix, keymap rebind, restore backup, AI confirm-and-cancel).
   - The recorded transcript is diffed against a golden transcript per scenario per SR. The harness is in v1.1 of the project plan but the scenario scripts and golden transcripts are produced manually for v1.0.
   - JAWS scenarios run separately when a JAWS-enabled runner is available; Narrator runs via UIA notifications.

No PR merges with any of these failing. A failure can be waived only by the accessibility lead, with an issue link and an expiry date.

### 9.10 VPAT / ACR generation

- The conformance matrix in 9.3 is the source of truth.
- A script (`tools/gen_vpat.py`) renders the matrix into an ITI VPAT 2.5 Rev INT form (the ICT industry-standard template) and a Word document, plus a markdown ACR for the website.
- The ACR is published with every release and links each row back to the corresponding test.
- VPATs cover WCAG 2.2, Section 508, and EN 301 549.

### 9.11 Certification path

- v1.0 self-certifies WCAG 2.2 AA, Section 508 (revised), and EN 301 549 v3.2.1 via the ACR.
- An independent third-party audit (target: TPGi, Deque, or Level Access) is commissioned for v1.0 release. Findings are tracked publicly in a `compliance/` folder of the repository.
- Outstanding findings have target dates and a public regression register.

### 9.12 Gated regressions (CI must-pass list)

A build is blocked when any of the following regresses:

- Any cell in the WCAG matrix transitions from passing to failing.
- Any tab-order snapshot diff is unreviewed.
- Any contrast pair drops below threshold in any bundled theme.
- Any command in the registry loses a name, description, or keymap entry.
- Any dialog gains a keyboard trap.
- Any user-facing string fails the controlled-vocabulary or plain-language linter without an explicit waiver.
- Any custom control is introduced into the editor or palette path without an `wx.Accessible` subclass that passes the Inspect.exe parity test.
- Any SR transcript diff exceeds tolerance.

### 9.13 Dialog estate governance (DLG-3)

Every dialog in Quill is the single highest-risk accessibility surface in the UI: controls that do not work, focus landing on the wrong control, and rendering breakage all live in dialogs and are otherwise invisible to a source-only review. DLG-3 is the flagship structural-health refactor that makes the dialog estate correct by construction, source-of-truth, and machine-gated. It folds in and supersedes the earlier batch ambitions (the form-conversion wave and the individual AI-tool conversions).

**Surface policy (the non-negotiable standard).** Every dialog surface is exactly one of three sanctioned classifications, and no other dialog framework or bespoke modal surface may be introduced:

1. **`native`** — stock wx one-shot dialogs (`wx.MessageDialog`, `wx.RichMessageDialog`, `wx.MessageBox`, `wx.SingleChoiceDialog`, `wx.MultiChoiceDialog`, `wx.TextEntryDialog`, `wx.FileDialog`, `wx.DirDialog`, `wx.FindReplaceDialog`, `wx.ProgressDialog`, About). Native-first is the default for confirms, choices, simple text input, and file/folder selection.
2. **`web`** — sanctioned accessible web surfaces (`show_web_form`, the markdown/HTML preview dialog, the accessible chat view) used only where rich rendering, chat interaction, or dynamic multi-field forms are genuinely required, always with a native fallback.
3. **`hardened_custom`** — a `wx.Dialog` container composed _only_ of stock native controls (`wx.ListBox`, `wx.TextCtrl`, `wx.SearchCtrl`, `wx.CheckListBox`, `wx.Notebook`, `wx.Button`, …). These are "enhanced-native": real OS widgets in a dialog frame. No custom-drawn or owner-drawn controls are permitted in any dialog.

**Source-of-truth inventory.** The authoritative dialog inventory is generated from source, not from a checklist. `quill/tools/dialog_inventory.py` AST-scans all of `quill/**/*.py` and records every dialog surface under a stable, line-independent key (`<module>::<enclosing_qualname>::<kind>`) with its sanctioned classification. The committed snapshot is `tests/unit/ui/fixtures/dialog_inventory.json`, and two gates enforce it: `tests/unit/ui/test_dialog_inventory.py` fails on any new, moved, removed, or reclassified dialog or unsanctioned surface; and a registry cross-check inside the A11Y-4 banned-pattern gate fails the build on any unregistered or misclassified dialog. Adding a dialog forces a deliberate `python -m quill.tools.dialog_inventory --write` whose classification is reviewed in the diff. The manual companion checklist `dialogs.md` maps each shipped dialog to its keyboard command or menu path and is kept in sync, but it is not the inventory authority.

**Per-dialog accessibility interaction contract.** Every dialog must satisfy all of: deterministic initial focus on open; complete Tab / Shift+Tab traversal; an explicit default action (Enter); Escape/close always exits; preserved modal-result semantics; focus return to the initiating editor/control on close; the screen reader announces the title and every actionable control; and no trap, freeze, or silent state. Modal show is routed through the shared `dialog_contract` helpers (`apply_modal_ids`, `show_modal_dialog`), and raw `wx.Dialog(...)` always has a `Destroy()` (or `with` form) lifecycle and uses `wx.EXPAND` button sizers, never `wx.ALIGN_RIGHT`.

**Control-surface completeness.** For every dialog, every control surface is audited and explicitly dispositioned as **keep** (already excellent, evidence linked), **harden** (focus/tab/label/default/announcement improvements), or **replace** (native or sanctioned-web equivalent). No unlabeled, untabbable, unannounced, or ambiguous control remains.

**"Every dialog touched" definition.** A dialog counts as touched only when it has all three of: (1) a classification in the registry (`native`, `web`, or `hardened_custom`); (2) explicit conformance evidence (a focused source-contract test or behavior test); and (3) a confirmed `dialogs.md` mapping, updated if its naming, binding, or path changed. The authoritative inventory is generated from source — including non-`quill/ui` surfaces such as the startup storage chooser in `quill/__main__.py` and the nested describe-image source/file pickers in `quill/ui/main_frame_image.py` — so checklist-only review can never miss a surface. The exit criterion is 100% source coverage, not a fixed legacy count; the count is expected to rise as source-discovered dialogs are folded in.

**High-risk clusters (sequenced first).** The concentration of lifecycle/focus risk is known and drives wave order: (1) `main_frame.py` modal sprawl (largest concentration); (2) `assistant_tools.py` (high interaction complexity, async actions, many custom dialog classes); (3) the startup/onboarding chain (`run_startup_wizard`, first-run prompts, trust consent, web-preview handoff); (4) sticky notes (historical focus-landing issues); and (5) mixed rendering surfaces (native + web + fallback) where behavior parity must be explicitly pinned. Already in place and relied upon: the shared `dialog_contract.py` modal helpers, the banned-pattern gate's existing `wx.ALIGN_RIGHT` and raw-`wx.Dialog` destroy-path checks, and the existing behavior tests for preview, web-form, and onboarding navigation.

**Execution waves.** DLG-3 proceeds as: Phase 0 — authoritative source-generated registry + gates (delivered); Phase 1 — strengthened A11Y-4 static guard (delivered); Phase 2 — native conversion wave for hand-rolled dialogs that are really a single confirm / choice / text prompt, replaced with the stock one-shot equivalent, preserving all user-facing wording and outcomes; Phase 3 — enhanced-native standardization wave converging the genuinely multi-control dialogs onto one focus/default/lifecycle grammar via the shared contract (never flattened into one-shots where that would lose live search, lists, or streaming); Phase 4 — web-surface standardization only where rich rendering or dynamic forms are justified, with native-fallback parity and no raw HTML dumped into document tabs in onboarding/welcome paths; Phase 5 — startup/onboarding hardening (wizard, first-run, trust consent, crash recovery) for deterministic focus across chained modals, preserving the explicit-consent requirements and retiring the screen-reader startup-crash path; Phase 6 — assistant/AI tool dialog consolidation (`assistant_tools.py`, `ai_model_panel.py`, `style_panel.py`, `assistant_panel.py`) onto the same modal/focus/error contract with safe async/"busy" semantics; Phase 7 — CQ-16 characterization expansion around dialog-launch command paths (return values and side effects) before any CQ-1 decomposition; Phase 8 — manual NVDA baseline, JAWS spot (startup, assistant, sticky notes, watch profiles), and Narrator sanity passes across `dialogs.md`, each row carrying pass/fail evidence.

**Dialog-by-dialog coverage map (no section exempt).** Every checklist family in `dialogs.md` is in scope with a default disposition: file/session dialogs (native-flow normalization + modal/focus hardening); settings/customization/dialog-launch surfaces (enhanced-native consistency — menu editor, settings, command palette); navigation dialogs (keep stock/input surfaces, harden bookmark/list/tree flows); text-analysis dialogs (normalize spell/lookup/thesaurus list workflows); accessibility-tools dialogs (focus/read-order consistency in results dialogs); intake/report dialogs (standardized preview/report modals); read-aloud/OCR dialogs (keep the OCR review contract, harden nested chooser flows); sticky-notes dialogs (retain web-form where justified, harden vault/list/editor transitions); external-tools/format dialogs (enhanced-native standard patterns); compare dialogs (consistent list/option/preview focus); keymap dialogs (stock controls + predictable nested edit flow); appearance/backup/import dialogs (import/export previews and file-picker transitions hardened); watch-folder dialogs (nested editor/browse/preview paths hardened); notifications dialog (standardized close/default semantics); formatting dialogs (preserve `show_web_form` for Insert Link, harden list/YAML nested flows); macros dialogs (text-entry + management standardization); AI/assistant dialogs (the DLG-2 conversions folded in); BITS speech dialogs (provider/model/status contract hardening); feature/profile dialogs (profile-switch, health, and management consistency); help/startup/support dialogs (wizard/about/diagnostics/report-bug rendering and focus safety); selection-action dialogs (action-chooser semantics hardened); nested/secondary dialogs (explicit coverage for each path launched from a parent); power-tools dialogs (stock prompt/confirm consistency); and startup-only dialogs (crash recovery + untrusted-location remain top-priority hardened native flows).

**Conversion decisions (definitive).** Keep `native`: simple confirms and binary prompts, and stable stock file/folder/select/text prompts. Keep sanctioned `web`: markdown/HTML preview and rich rendered content, explicit multi-field forms where `show_web_form` is already stable and fallback-backed, and chat-centric surfaces with native fallback. Harden `hardened_custom` (not a web rewrite by default): complex list/CRUD/picker dialogs where stock controls are appropriate and lower-risk than a web migration, and interaction-heavy assistant panels that are not rich-rendering-centric. No untouched custom paths: any retained custom dialog must carry a written rationale plus a contract test.

**Operational mandates (enforcement, not intent).** Machine-enforced checks that must pass before merge: the expanded A11Y-4 banned-pattern gate with zero violations; the dialog-registry completeness check (no orphan dialogs); the source-contract tests for touched dialogs; the characterization checks for dialog-launch command paths; and the project-wide source-scan check (no dialog constructor or call-site outside the inventory). "Manual QA later" is never a substitute for these gates. Manual accessibility verification is release-blocking per touched family: a keyboard-only pass (open, traverse, act, cancel, close, focus return), a screen-reader pass (NVDA baseline; JAWS/Narrator spot by risk), a nested-flow pass (child dialogs launched from parents), and a fallback-parity pass (web-backed dialogs validated in native fallback). Every dialog change records its impacted dialog id(s), the control surfaces touched, the classification decision, the tests added/updated, and the manual verification result; missing evidence means the change is incomplete.

**Anti-regression controls.** No mixed ad-hoc modal patterns may be introduced during the refactor; no dialog merges without a classification and test evidence; and no `dialogs.md` drift is allowed in a PR. The source-of-truth rule is absolute: before closing any dialog work item, run the inventory scanner across the entire `quill` package, and if scanner output and the committed registry disagree, the work is incomplete regardless of checklist status.

**Definition of done.** DLG-3 is done only when: 100% of source-scanned dialogs are touched and classified (not just a legacy checklist count); simple confirm/message/choice/text flows are native one-shots; rich/input flows use only sanctioned web surfaces with fallback parity; every control in every dialog is inventoried and dispositioned (`keep`/`harden`/`replace`); any retained `hardened_custom` dialog has an explicit rationale and at least one focused source-contract or behavior test; the strengthened A11Y-4 guard blocks contract regressions; the startup wizard and first-run chains are stable and non-crashing with a screen reader active on Windows and macOS; and `dialogs.md` is synchronized with the final command paths and nested flows.

## 10. Technical infrastructure

This section is the canonical engineering blueprint for Quill. It defines the module structure, every dependency (pinned, licensed, justified), the per-feature technical specifications, the threading and concurrency model, the data layout, the build and packaging pipeline, supply-chain integrity, observability, the plugin runtime, the update mechanism, the security architecture, the development workflow, and the coding standards.

### 10.2 Complete dependency manifest

Every direct dependency is listed below with the pinned version range Quill 1.0 will ship against, the license, the reason it is in the tree, and any constraints. Pins are tight in production builds and loose in development.

#### 10.2.1 Runtime, Python

#### 10.2.4 License posture

- Quill itself is **MIT-licensed** (default; final decision still tracked in Open Questions).
- LGPL components (`odfpy`, `chardet`, `liblouis`) are linked dynamically; we publish the license texts and a `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md` in the installer.
- MPL-2.0 components (`cyhunspell`, `pikepdf`) are linked dynamically; modifications to those files (if any) are published.
- AGPL components (`ebooklib`) are used as a library; we do not host a network service that exposes their interface to end users, which keeps us outside the AGPL trigger.
- All licenses are aggregated automatically into `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md` by `tools/gen_notices.py` at build time; the build fails if any new package lacks a license entry.

### 10.4 Threading and concurrency model

- **UI thread**: owns all wx widgets and the editor buffer. Never blocks for more than 16 ms.
- **I/O thread pool** (`concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor`, default 4): file open, save, autosave, backup writes, settings persistence, bookmark writes, fingerprint compute.
- **Compute thread pool** (default 2): spell-check background pass, outline build for very large documents, document statistics for >1 MB, accessibility audit for >100 KB.
- **asyncio loop** (via `wxasync`): all HTTP I/O (AI providers, Open from URL, update check). Cancellable per task.
- **OCR worker process**: Tesseract runs in a child process per OCR job, isolated to avoid GIL contention and crash blast radius.
- **Marshalling**: any callback into wx uses `wx.CallAfter` or `wx.CallLater`. No direct cross-thread wx calls.
- **Cancellation**: every long-running task accepts a `quill.core.events.CancelToken`. Cancellation is checked at fixed safe points (every page, every 1 MB of read, every HTTP chunk).
- **Backpressure**: the I/O pool uses bounded queues; new tasks wait, never spawn-and-forget.
- **No threading.Lock around shared mutable state in `core`**. The document model is owned by the UI thread; workers receive snapshots and return new snapshots; `wx.CallAfter` merges. This invariant is enforced by lint (`ruff` custom rule) that flags `threading.Lock` outside `platform/`.

All JSON files validate against schemas in `quill/core/schemas/`. All writes are atomic (`tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile` in the same directory + `os.replace`).

### 10.6 Packaging, signing, supply chain

- **Frozen build**: PyInstaller with one-folder layout (faster start than one-file). UPX disabled (no compression; SmartScreen friendliness, debug symbols intact).
- **Installer**: Inno Setup 6 with per-user (`{userappdata}`) default, system-wide optional. Components: Core, Tesseract OCR (English by default; additional languages downloadable post-install), Hunspell dictionaries (launch-language set by default), JAWS script (optional). License screen lists `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md`.
- **Portable zip**: identical layout without registry writes; uses `%APPDATA%` per Windows convention.
- **Signing**: EV code-signing certificate; `signtool` signs every `.exe`, `.dll`, and the installer; timestamps via DigiCert RFC 3161 timestamp server. SmartScreen reputation built before public launch.
- **Reproducible builds**: the build pipeline pins every dependency via `uv` lockfile; the lockfile is committed; the build container is pinned to a SHA-tagged Windows image.
- **SBOM**: a CycloneDX 1.5 SBOM is generated per build (`tools/gen_sbom.py` using `pip-audit --format=cyclonedx`) and attached to the GitHub release.
- **Supply-chain scanning**: every PR runs `pip-audit` and `osv-scanner`; CRITICAL or HIGH vulnerabilities fail the build.
- **Provenance**: GitHub Actions runs with OIDC; artefacts are signed with Sigstore `cosign` and the `cosign.bundle` is published next to each release artefact.
- **Update channel**: a signed JSON manifest (Ed25519 signature; key pinned in the app) lists current stable, beta, and security-only releases with SHA-256s. Quill checks on launch only when the user has opted in (manual `Check for Updates` is always available).
- **Footprint**: realistic target is 180–220 MB installed with English Tesseract data and English/UK + Spanish/French/German Hunspell dictionaries. A **Quill Lite** option ships at ~90 MB and downloads dictionaries and Tesseract on first use.

### 10.7 Build and dev environment

- **Python 3.12** pinned via `uv python install`.
- **Lockfile**: `uv.lock` committed; `uv sync` reproduces the dev environment exactly.
- **Dev install**: `uv sync --all-extras` plus `pre-commit install` for hooks.
- **Pre-commit**: ruff format, ruff lint, mypy on `core/` and `io/`, controlled-vocabulary linter, contrast checker, tab-order snapshot check, license-notice generator.
- **Local accessibility audit**: `python -m quill.tools.a11y_audit` launches Quill under pywinauto and runs the static + headless layers in under five minutes.
- **Local SR scenario**: `python -m quill.tools.sr_scenario --scenario find_chain --reader nvda` launches NVDA against Quill, replays a scenario, and writes a transcript to `out/`.

### 10.8 Continuous integration and delivery

- **Provider**: GitHub Actions.
- **Matrix**: Windows 10 22H2, Windows 11 24H2; Python 3.12; wxPython current stable.
- **Jobs**:
  1. **Lint** (ruff, mypy, jsonschema validation of bundled schemas).
  2. **Unit tests** (`pytest tests/unit -n auto`).
  3. **Integration tests** (`pytest tests/integration`); covers every format reader and writer against a fixture corpus stored in Git LFS.
  4. **A11y static** (controlled vocab, plain language, keymap audit, contrast checker, tab-order snapshot diff).
  5. **A11y headless** (`pytest tests/a11y` via pywinauto + Accessibility Insights CLI).
  6. **Perf smoke** (`pytest tests/perf`, asserts the targets in §11).
  7. **Build** (PyInstaller, Inno Setup, signtool, Sigstore cosign).
  8. **Supply chain** (pip-audit, osv-scanner, SBOM generation).
  9. **SR scenario nightly** (NVDA scenarios on a self-hosted runner).
- **Release branch**: `release/x.y` triggers a full build + sign + publish to GitHub Releases and the auto-update manifest.
- **Triage SLA**: SR transcript diffs reviewed within 24 hours.

### 10.9 Observability

- **Logging**: stdlib `logging`, rotating file handler, INFO level by default. Log records contain action name, outcome, duration; never document content; paths are hashed.
- **Crash handler**: a `faulthandler`-based hook writes a `quill-crash-YYYY-MM-DDTHHMMSS.dump` with the Python traceback and a redacted environment snapshot. On next launch Quill offers to include the crash in a diagnostics bundle for support; never auto-sends.
- **Metrics**: opt-in only; counters per feature use; transported by `httpx` to a self-hosted endpoint over TLS; cleartext example shown before opt-in.
- **Event bus**: an internal sync event bus (`core.events`) records the last 50 commands and notable lifecycle events; these are what Help → Save Diagnostics ships.

### 10.10 Plugin runtime (v1.0 surface, v1.1 full)

- **v1.0**: the plugin loader skeleton exists; only first-party plugins (JAWS script, additional Hunspell dictionaries) are loadable. The full third-party plugin runtime ships in v1.1.
- **Manifest** (`plugin.json`): id, name, version, license, capabilities (`commands`, `format_reader`, `format_writer`, `palette_entry`, `settings_page`, `keybinding_default`, `statusbar_cell`), requested permissions (`network: never|on_action`, `filesystem: read|write`, `subprocess: none|listed`).
- **Discovery**: `%APPDATA%\Quill\plugins\<id>\plugin.json` plus `entry_points` group `quill.plugins` (for pip-installed plugins).
- **Lifecycle**: load → register → enable; disabled plugins keep their settings.
- **Sandboxing (v1.1)**: each plugin runs in its own thread; network and subprocess calls require an explicit per-action consent or a setting that whitelists the plugin's manifest-declared hosts; UI surfaces created by plugins must pass the same accessibility static checks as core.
- **Versioning**: plugins declare the Quill API version they target; the loader rejects mismatched majors.

### 10.11 Security architecture

- **Secrets**: AI provider keys and remote site passwords are stored via Windows Credential Manager where available, with DPAPI-encrypted fallback (`platform.windows.dpapi`) when vault APIs are unavailable; never in plain text on disk; never logged; never in diagnostics bundles. macOS builds use the Keychain facade at `platform.macos.keychain`.
- **Document data**: never leaves the machine without per-action consent.
- **Network calls**: an internal `ai.safety.consent(action, host, size_estimate)` gate is required before any network call; the call records what was sent (action name, host, size only) in the audit log. Remote I/O is inventoried in `quill/tools/network_egress_audit.py`; a new transport call site without a written rationale is a CI failure.
- **Untrusted XML**: S3 and WebDAV listings are routed through `quill.core.safe_xml.fromstring`. Documents that declare a DTD or custom entity (billion-laughs, XXE) are refused with a friendly `RemoteTransportError` and never reach the parser.
- **Updates**: manifest signature verified with a pinned Ed25519 public key; artefact SHA-256 verified before install.
- **File handling**: file dialogs use the OS dialog (`wx.FileDialog`) so the user controls disclosure scope; the trusted-locations system (5.31) prevents silent opening of suspicious files.
- **Path traversal**: every settings/keymap/plugin path is normalised and validated; no `..` segments accepted.
- **JSON parsing**: bounded depth and size via custom decoder hooks; refuses to parse settings files over 10 MB or beyond depth 32.
- **YAML parsing**: `safe_load` only.
- **Subprocess**: limited to Tesseract and (post-v1.1) plugin-declared binaries; arguments are always passed as lists; no `shell=True`.
- **Threat model**: a malicious document might try to (a) crash the parser, (b) request a keymap override to bind dangerous keys, (c) trigger an outbound network request. (a) parsers are fuzz-tested with `atheris`; (b) keymap overrides require explicit consent (5.50); (c) network is gated.
- **Responsible disclosure**: a `SECURITY.md` file documents the disclosure email and PGP key.

### 10.12 Update mechanism

- v1.0 ships **manual update check**: `Help → Check for Updates…` fetches the signed manifest, verifies it, compares versions, offers to download the next stable.
- The download is verified (SHA-256) and Sigstore-attested; the installer is signed; the user runs it.
- The asset download streams in fixed-size chunks and reports progress through an accessible callback, so screen-reader users hear coarse, non-spammy progress announcements (for example 25/50/75 percent) instead of a silent wait.
- After a successful download Quill presents an **Update downloaded** dialog offering, as available, **Install now…** (Windows `.exe`/`.msi`), **Open the containing folder**, or **Close**. Install-now runs the in-app pre-update health check first.
- The update-available dialog includes a **Skip this version** action; a skipped version is remembered and suppressed on silent launch checks until a newer version appears or the user checks manually.
- Silent launch checks are throttled to at most once per 24 hours (recorded via the last-check timestamp); a manual `Check for Updates` always runs regardless of the throttle.
- A small in-app pre-update health check ensures the user's editor has no unsaved documents before launching the installer.
- Auto-update lands in v1.1 with a Squirrel-style delta channel.

### 10.13 Internationalisation infrastructure

- All UI strings flow through `gettext`; the `_()` callable is the sole permitted lookup.
- `.po` source files live under `quill/ui/locale/<lang>/LC_MESSAGES/quill.po`; `.mo` are compiled at build time.
- Pluralisation uses `ngettext`.
- Date/number formatting uses `babel`.
- Bidirectional text in user documents is rendered by the OS edit control; full RTL UI is v1.2.
- A translation portal (Weblate or Crowdin) is set up at v1.0 beta; community translators are credited in About and release notes.
- Translation operations follow a documented contributor plan with:
  - gettext `POT -> PO -> MO` workflow,
  - translator comments and placeholder-preservation rules,
  - beta translation push and pre-release string freeze,
  - CI quality gates for extraction, syntax, compile, and placeholder validation.
- Contributor process and policy reference: `docs/localization/translation-contributor-plan.md`.

### 10.14 Performance budgets and instrumentation

All performance targets in §11 are enforced by `tests/perf/`. Each test asserts against a budget; regressions over 15% fail the build. Microbenchmarks live next to the code they measure. Real-world startup time is measured by a stopwatch fixture that uses Windows' high-resolution timer.

### 10.15 Coding standards and review

- **Style**: ruff format (PEP 8 with relaxed line length 100).
- **Typing**: strict mypy in `core/` and `io/`; gradual in `ui/`; types required on all public functions.
- **Docstrings**: Google style; every public API has one.
- **Imports**: absolute; no wildcard imports; `wx` may only be imported from `quill.ui` and `quill.platform.windows`.
- **Public API stability**: `quill.core`, `quill.io`, `quill.plugins.api` follow semver; breaking changes require a major bump and a deprecation cycle of one minor version.
- **PR review**: two approvals required; one must be from a maintainer; any change to `ui/`, `core/a11y/`, or `core/keymap.py` additionally requires sign-off from the accessibility lead.
- **Issue triage SLA**: P0 (data loss, crash on launch, accessibility regression) within 24 h; P1 (function broken) within 5 business days; P2 within the next release.

### 10.16 Module ownership and SOLID boundaries

- `core/*` knows nothing about `wx`; tested without UI; can be reused by a future TUI or web front-end.
- `io/*` modules each export `read(path) -> Document`, optionally `write(doc, path)`, and `outline(doc) -> Outline | None`; no other contracts.
- `ui/*` modules consume the command registry and the document model; UI components never read from disk directly.
- `platform/windows/*` is the only place where `pywin32`, `comtypes`, or registry access is allowed.
- `ai/*` modules conform to a single `Provider` ABC with `complete`, `improve_reading_order`, `cancel`, `estimate_cost` methods.
- `plugins/api.py` is the only file plugins import from; everything else is internal.

### 10.17 Magic, by construction

The engineering choices above add up to the user-visible magic the product promises:

- Stock controls everywhere keep MSAA/UIA pristine; speech is correct without scripts.
- Atomic writes plus `.bak` plus autosave plus persistent undo make "I lost work" almost impossible.
- A single announcement funnel keeps speech behaviour identical across NVDA, JAWS, and Narrator.
- Pinned, audited dependencies and reproducible builds keep "works on my machine" out of the loop.
- A small command registry plus a three-layer keymap plus a discoverable palette mean every feature is reachable, learnable, and rebindable.
- A WCAG matrix wired to CI means accessibility cannot quietly regress; if it slips, the build fails.

## 11. Performance targets

- Cold start to blank document: under 1.5 seconds on a 2020-era laptop.
- Open a 200-page text-based PDF (local extraction): under 6 seconds.
- Open a 1 MB Markdown file: under 250 ms.
- Find first match in a 1 MB document: under 100 ms.
- Spell check full document (50 000 words, en-GB): under 1.2 seconds.
- Quick-fix suggestion ranking per misspelling: under 10 ms.
- Command palette open + first results visible: under 50 ms.
- Memory at idle with one empty document: under 150 MB.
- Autosave write: under 50 ms, non-blocking.

---

## 12. Privacy and security

- Local first. Nothing leaves the machine without an explicit per-action confirmation.
- AI provider keys stored via Windows Credential Manager when available, with DPAPI-encrypted fallback; never plain text.
- **Remote site passwords** (FTP, SFTP, WebDAV, S3) follow the same three-tier ladder: **Windows Credential Manager → DPAPI-protected JSON under `%APPDATA%\Quill\` → macOS Keychain facade**. Plain-text on disk is never the path of last resort.
- Logs never include document content. Logs include action names and outcomes only.
- Spell-check learning data stays on disk under the user profile and can be wiped from a single button.
- Crash reports are opt-in and scrubbed of paths and content.
- All file dialogs use the OS dialog so the user controls disclosure.
- **Remote I/O gating.** Every outbound call site is inventoried in `quill/tools/network_egress_audit.py` with a written rationale. A new transport call that is not added to that inventory is a CI failure. Cloud endpoints (S3, HTTPS, WebDAV-over-HTTPS) must use TLS; FTPS is enforced when available. Verified TLS context (`quill.core.net.verified_ssl_context`) is used for every HTTPS request.
- **Untrusted-XML protection.** S3 and WebDAV listings are parsed through `quill.core.safe_xml.fromstring`, which routes through `defusedxml` and refuses any document that declares a DTD or custom entity. The transport layer translates both parse errors and unsafe-XML refusals into a typed `RemoteTransportError` so the screen reader announces a single, friendly message.
- Network calls show host, payload size, and estimated cost (where the provider supplies it) before sending.
- Startup includes a trust/privacy/responsible-AI consent acknowledgement before guided onboarding continues.

---

## 13. Internationalisation and localisation

- All UI strings wrapped in `_()` from `gettext`.
- Initial languages: English (US), English (UK), Spanish, French, German, Brazilian Portuguese, Polish, Japanese.
- Right-to-left support deferred to v1.2.
- Spell-check dictionaries shipped for the initial languages plus a downloader for others.

---

## 14. Telemetry

- Off by default. The setting is presented in plain language, with an example payload shown verbatim before opt-in.
- If enabled, anonymised counters only: feature used, error counts.

---

## 15. Success metrics

- Time to open a typical PDF and reach the first searchable word.
- Number of screen-reader announcement regressions per release (target: zero).
- Crash-free sessions per week (target: 99.5 percent).
- User-reported "I lost work" incidents (target: zero, hard).
- Spell-check first-suggestion acceptance rate after 30 days of use (target: above 70 percent).
- Command palette task completion time vs menu navigation (target: at least 2x faster for top 20 commands).
- Adoption: monthly active users among the NVDA add-on community.
- Qualitative: 20+ unsolicited testimonials in the first 6 months saying "this feels calm."

## 16. Release plan

v1.0 is locked to features we can build and ship at the highest quality bar with no novel research dependencies and no fragile third-party requirements. Anything that requires unproven libraries, brittle parsers, ML training, or external binaries beyond the bundled set is deferred to the backlog in [section 17](#17-backlog-and-deferred-items).

Every v1.0 feature in the list below is **Confidence A**: a defined library exists, a known engineering path is mapped, accessibility behaviour is predictable, and a working prototype can be produced in a single sprint.

---

## 17. Backlog and deferred items

Everything below is intentionally out of v1.0. Each item is either yellow (achievable but requires more engineering than the v1.0 quality bar permits in time) or red (depends on unstable third-party formats, large native dependencies, or research-flavoured uplift we will not promise without measurement).

The organising principle is simple: **v1.0 ships only Confidence A. Confidence B and C land in v1.1–1.3 behind opt-in plugins and feature flags, with quality grades shown to the user.**

### 17.1 Format support deferred to plugins (v1.1+)

| Format | Why deferred | Target plugin |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Legacy Word `.doc`, PowerPoint `.ppt`, Excel `.xls` | Need headless LibreOffice for high quality; LibreOffice is a ~300 MB dependency | LibreOffice Bridge |
| WordPerfect `.wpd`, Works `.wps`, Windows Write `.wri`, StarOffice | Python bindings flaky on Windows; covered well by headless LibreOffice | LibreOffice Bridge |
| Apple iWork `.pages`, `.key`, `.numbers` | Modern iWork is a proprietary IWA archive; coverage is partial | iWork Bridge (best-effort) |
| OneNote `.one` | Closed format, no stable open library | OneNote Bridge via Microsoft Graph (requires sign-in) |
| Kindle `.azw3`, `.mobi`, FB2, LIT, LRF, PRC, PDB, TCR | Best handled by Calibre's conversion engine | Calibre Bridge |
| Kindle `.kfx` | DRM-protected by design; Quill will not break DRM | Calibre Bridge (user must already have a DRM-stripped copy) |
| DjVu | Native `djvulibre` dependency; installer weight | DjVu Plugin |
| Comics `cbz`, `cbr` | RAR (`cbr`) requires non-free `unrar.dll` | Comics Plugin |
| PostScript `ps`, `eps` | Needs Ghostscript native binary | PostScript Plugin |
| XPS, OXPS | Niche; needs additional reader | XPS Plugin |
| MSG, PST, MBOX | `libpff` works but coverage on encrypted/corporate PSTs is uneven | Mail Bridge |
| Web archives WARC, WACZ, `.webarchive` | Format zoo; useful but not ubiquitous | Web Archive Plugin |
| Parquet, Feather | Niche analyst use; large native deps | Data Files Plugin |
| EVTX, ETL | Native Windows log formats; niche audience | Logs Plugin |
| HEIC, AVIF, JP2 | Native binary dependencies (`pillow-heif`, `pillow-avif-plugin`) | Modern Images Plugin |
| Chat exports (WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack, Discord, Teams, Zoom, Otter, ChatGPT) | Export formats churn 2–4 times per year; requires ongoing maintenance | Chat Exports Plugin (independently versioned) |
| OneNote, Evernote `.enex`, Bear, Simplenote | Mixed formats; per-app quirks | Notes Bridge Plugin |
| Audio + transcript pair playback | Needs media playback; out of scope for core editor | Audio Transcript Plugin |

### 17.2 Features deferred

- **Spell-check contextual reranker.** Ships as opt-in experimental in v1.1 once measured uplift over Hunspell-alone is demonstrated on a labelled corpus.
- **Per-paragraph automatic language detection** for the spell-check dictionary stack. Short paragraphs and code-mixed text make this unreliable today.
- **Tier-2 "enhanced local" PDF extractor.** No pure-Python local layout analyser meets the bar. v1.0 ships tier 1 (local) and tier 3 (opt-in AI). A real tier 2 returns when there is a credible local model.
- **PDF heading synthesis from font-size analysis** when no embedded bookmarks exist. Available as an opt-in experimental switch but not promoted in v1.0.
- **Auto-update.** v1.0 ships manual update check with signed manifest. Squirrel-style auto-update lands in v1.1.
- **NVDA speech-viewer CI harness.** No supported automation API; we will build a test driver in v1.1.
- **Dynamic screen-reader shortcut introspection.** v1.0 uses a curated static list of well-known NVDA, JAWS, and Narrator chords; explains conflicts using that list. Dynamic introspection of user-customised SR bindings remains out of scope (no public API).
- **Right-to-left UI.** v1.2.
- **Project workspaces and Find in Folder.** v1.2.
- **Multi-cursor / column selection.** Not planned; conflicts with screen-reader navigation patterns.
- **History panel (visual undo stack).** Backlog.
- **Macro recording and playback.** Backlog.
- **Linked-notes / wikilink editor (Obsidian-style).** Backlog.
- **Per-file-class backup retention policy.** v1.0 ships a single global retention rule (5.13). v1.1 introduces per-format-class defaults (e.g. 100 backups for source code, 25 for long-form documents) once we have telemetry on user save patterns.
- **Single-line compose box mode.** A small, screen-reader-optimised composer dialog whose Enter sends back to the main editor at the cursor. Useful for slow-speech users; needs user testing to confirm it is worth the surface area. Backlog for v1.1.
- **Advanced model lifecycle in core app flow.** Quill now ships a local Writing Assistant shell, prompt presets, generated tool catalog, assistant onboarding, AI Hub entry point, Prompt Studio custom templates, Agent Center guided plans, AI connection preferences, connection verification/model discovery actions, searchable model selection, provider-aware guided recommendations, AI menu status-detail feedback, and sandboxed Python runner. Connection diagnostics use a structured error taxonomy that separates authentication failure (HTTP 401) from permission/access denial (HTTP 403), rate limiting, warm-up/not-ready states, local-server-not-running, and unreachable endpoints, with a bounded warm-up retry/backoff so a model that is still loading is reported as warming up rather than failed. The status taxonomy is matched on numeric status codes rather than substring matching, so host ports such as `localhost:11403` cannot be misread as a 403. Broader built-in model catalog lifecycle and background prefetch policy remain future work.

### 17.4 Explicitly out of scope for Quill (any version unless re-evaluated)

Quill is opinionated about what it is _not_. The following are intentionally and permanently out of scope unless a future PRD revision re-opens the question.

- **Visual word-processor styling in the editor.** No bold/italic/colour as direct formatting. Quill is screen-reader-first; users who want WYSIWYG should use Word. Markdown supports inline emphasis textually.
- **Real-time collaborative editing.** Not in v1.x. The architecture does not preclude it; we are not committing to it.
- **Cloud-sync of documents.** Sync is for keymap and settings only (8.8). Document storage stays on the user's machine and chosen cloud-drive folder.
- **Mobile, web, macOS, or Linux ports.** Cross-platform is post-v2 at earliest. The `core/` layer has no `wx` so it remains _possible_, not _committed_.
- **Voice input / dictation.** Use Windows dictation; Quill does not reinvent the mic/STT stack. An opt-in Hey QUILL command layer may sit on top of dictation and dispatch existing Quill commands, but it stays silent and only listens while dictation is active.
- **AI authoring assistant.** The current build exposes a local Writing Assistant shell, prompt presets, Prompt Studio reusable prompt templates, Agent Center guided profiles, AI Hub launch surface, AI connection preferences (Ollama local/cloud, OpenAI, Claude, OpenRouter, Gemini, Azure OpenAI, custom OpenAI-compatible), provider verification/model discovery, searchable model filtering, status-detail accessibility announcements, and a sandboxed Python tool. The quick writing actions (Rewrite Selection, Summarize Selection, Continue Writing, Fix Grammar) each guard on the AI-enabled setting regardless of entry point (menu, command palette, or keybinding) and fall back to a sensible scope when there is no selection (paragraph at cursor for rewrite/grammar, whole document for summarize), announcing the chosen scope and word count. The AI status line also detects a saved key that cannot be decrypted on the current device (for example after a portable install is moved to another Windows account) and prompts the user to re-enter the key rather than reporting a generic authentication error. Longer-horizon autocomplete policy tuning and richer model-catalog management remain future work.
- **Project workspaces and Find in Folder.** Deferred to v1.2 (see 17.2).
- **Embedded media playback inside documents.** Out of scope for the editor.
- **PDF form filling and signing.** Out of scope.
- **Macro recording and playback.** Out of scope for v1.x.
- **Bundled font installation.** Quill uses system fonts only.
- **Telemetry by default.** Telemetry is and remains opt-in, off out of the box.
- **Anything that breaks DRM.** Quill will not include or escalate to tooling that removes DRM from any file, including KFX.

### 17.3 Confidence grades shown to the user

The Format Support settings page displays a grade per format:

- **Grade A**: bundled engine, high coverage, extensively tested. (All v1.0 in-box formats.)
- **Grade B**: bundled engine with known edge cases, or plugin with a stable upstream. Quality is good, occasional fallbacks expected.
- **Grade C**: plugin required to read at all, or the upstream format itself is unstable. Best-effort.

Grade is displayed prominently in the Open dialog when the user picks a file of a non-A format, with one line of context (“Kindle `.azw3` requires the Calibre Bridge plugin; current grade B with Calibre installed”) so expectations are set before the user hits Enter.

## 18. Risks and mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
| --- | --- |
| Custom wx behaviour breaks a screen reader on a Windows update | Strict policy of stock controls; CI accessibility tests; rapid patch process |
| PDF extraction quality varies wildly | Layered extractors with scoring; manual escalation tiers; opt-in AI repair |
| AI provider API drift or pricing change | Provider-agnostic interface; user supplies key |
| Plugins introduce accessibility regressions | Manifest must declare UI surfaces; review checklist; plugins disabled by default |
| Custom spell engine underperforms TinySpell/Word | Layered architecture; Hunspell baseline; learning loop; published benchmarks |
| Keymap conflicts with screen-reader shortcuts | Explicit detection at capture time; refuse to capture conflicting chords with clear explanation |
| Localisation lags | Ship English first; community translation site; per-language readiness gates |
| Users expect bold and italic | Clear positioning; markdown supports inline emphasis textually; v1.x evaluation only after stable base |

## 19. Open questions

1. License: MIT for maximum adoption, or GPL to keep derivatives open. Leaning MIT.
2. Branding: Quill is a placeholder. Final name to be chosen with community input.
3. Should the contextual reranker be opt-in given memory cost?
4. JAWS scripts: ship a small one for live-region parity, or rely on `wx.Accessible` alone?
5. Hosting model for the community plugin registry.
6. Two-key chord sequences in default keymap: how many should we ship by default, given screen-reader users often prefer single chords?

---

## 20. Why this can be magical

The magic is not in any single feature. It is in the absence of friction:

- The window opens and the cursor is in the right place.
- Save just works. Save As appears exactly when it should.
- A PDF that was unreadable an hour ago becomes a clean searchable document with one keystroke.
- A bookmark you set last week still lands on the right paragraph after the document grew by three pages.
- The command palette knows the word you half remembered, and it tells you which key triggers it so you can learn the keystroke next time.
- If a keystroke does not suit you, you change it from the same palette without leaving the flow.
- Spell check is fast, local, and gets better the longer you use it. It never sends your writing anywhere.
- The screen reader never says anything you did not need to hear, and never goes quiet when you needed it to speak.
- When the power dies, the next launch returns your work.

Quill aims to feel like a very good fountain pen: simple in the hand, faithful on the page, and quietly delightful every time you reach for it.

## 21. Project delivery TODO (living checklist)

Last updated: 2026-06-02

Todo counts: **160 v1.0 items** | **160 completed** | **0 remaining** (v1.0 scope); post-1.0 foundation work tracked in 21.17+ below.

### GLOW implementation roadmap

This roadmap is the GLOW-branded implementation order for the shared document-intelligence work now being folded into Quill.

1. **CSV Mode first.** Finish the accessible grid editor, the default-choice prompt, remembered CSV preference, and the ability to return to normal text editing at any time.
2. **Word support next.** Complete MarkItDown-first Word intake, semantic diagnostics, and review/fix hooks for `.docx` and legacy `.doc` flows.
3. **PowerPoint support next.** Finish slide linearisation, speaker-notes extraction, and reading-order diagnostics for `.pptx` and legacy `.ppt` flows.
4. **Then the rest of the document families.** Extend the same shared path to PDF refinement, EPUB/pages tuning, legacy Office fallbacks, version transparency, and provenance reporting.

The governing rules remain the same throughout the roadmap: local-first processing, no silent network calls, explicit consent for outbound content, and deterministic extraction before higher-level analysis.

### 21.14 Feature registry and profiles

- [x] Add a central feature registry module with metadata and dependency graphs.
- [x] Add layered feature-profile loading and merging.
- [x] Add shipped profile definitions for Essential, Writer, Reader and Student, Office and Admin, Accessibility Professional, Developer and Power Text, Low Vision, Braille and Screen Reader Power User, and Full Quill.
- [x] Add a Profiles and Features settings page.
- [x] Add first-run profile selection onboarding.
- [x] Add command, menu, status-bar, settings, help, and format-handler feature ID gating.
- [x] Add dependency enforcement when enabling and disabling features.
- [x] Add profile import/export storage with schema validation.
- [x] Add locked safety rules that cannot be overridden by user profiles or imports.
- [x] Add feature metadata labels for risk, maturity, privacy, and network impact.
- [x] Add profile comparison preview in the Profiles and Features page.

### 21.15 Macro and compare expansion

- [x] Implement macro command capture across menu/shortcut/palette execution (excluding macro control commands and playback recursion).
- [x] Complete macro management UX and persistence polish for Start/Stop/Play/Manage workflows.
- [x] Expand interactive compare commands (next/previous/current/list/sync toggle/options) beyond diff-tab-only hunk navigation.
- [x] Add multi-document interactive compare support (3+ open docs) with structured announcements.
- [x] Add compare summary and copy/export actions (copy current/all differences, save markdown summary).
- [x] Audit transform/convert menu placement and command-ID consistency after Convert-menu migration.
- [x] Synchronize PRD checklist details with implemented macro and compare scope.
- [x] Run macro/compare regression suite and resolve resulting failures.

### 21.16 wx stability and hang resistance

- [x] Add a `quill.stability` package for logging, diagnostics, dispatch, heartbeat, task management, safe subprocesses, guarded regex, memory tracing, safe mode, and feature contracts.
- [x] Configure startup logging through a queue-backed listener so the wx main thread never blocks on file I/O.
- [x] Enable faulthandler at startup and keep a manual thread-stack dump path available from the CLI.
- [x] Add a `wx.Timer` heartbeat and watchdog that detect stalled UI loops.
- [x] Centralize worker-to-UI handoff through `wx.CallAfter`, custom wx events, and a coalesced progress reporter.
- [x] Route user-supplied regex through timeout-aware matching helpers.
- [x] Add a safe subprocess helper with explicit timeouts.
- [x] Add optional tracemalloc support and diagnostic bundle support for freeze reports.
- [x] Add a Safe Mode configuration path and startup flag handling.
- [x] Add feature contract validation for risky features.

### 21.17 Watch Profiles automation engine

- [x] Replace the legacy single-folder watcher with a multi-profile `quill.core.watch_service` facade (wx-free).
- [x] Add `watch_profiles`/`watch_profile_store` with schema-validated, independently enabled named profiles.
- [x] Add `watch_queue`/`watch_worker` so watch processing runs off the UI thread and marshals results through `wx.CallAfter`.
- [x] Add `watch_actions` for per-profile actions (open in editor, run intake action).
- [x] Add the accessible Watch Queue Monitor (queued/in-progress/completed/failed, with retry) under the Watch menu.
- [x] Surface watch status and failures through the existing status/notification channel; no silent failures.

### 21.18 Settings home and feature profiles UI

- [x] Add a registry-driven tabbed Settings dialog rendered from `quill.core.settings_registry`.
- [x] Add a settings search box (SET-6) that jumps to a matching control across pages.
- [x] Add Reset to Factory Defaults and profile Import paths that re-apply settings consistently (theme, spellcheck, wrap, tabs, menus).
- [x] Add feature-profile export/import (`.qpf`) with schema validation and locked-safety enforcement.

### 21.19 Update experience enhancements

- [x] Enhance the in-app update checker with manual Check for Updates, throttled background checks, and a skip-this-version option.
- [x] Add accessible streaming download progress announcements and a post-download Install/Open/Close dialog (reveal in folder, launch installer).
- [x] Record `skipped_update_version` and `last_update_check` in settings (documented in sections 5.74 and 10.12).

### 21.20 Foundation work in progress (post-1.0)

- [x] Wire the `quill.core.menu_customization` model into an accessible Menu Editor UI for **top-level** menus: reorder, rename, show/hide, and one Reset to Factory Defaults, opened from Edit > Customize Menus... (`app.menu_editor`). The build applies the saved customization through a post-build transform pass on the menu bar that bails out untouched if anything looks unexpected.
- [ ] Extend the Menu Editor to per-item reordering/hiding and editor context-menu entries (the `quill.core.menu_customization` model already supports both; the remaining work is the item-level UI and a stable item-key binding in the menu build).

### 21.21 AI chat, Prompt Library, and Quillin Manager (Phase 2/3)

- [x] Add `ask_ai` dialog with provider selection (OpenRouter, OpenAI, Ollama), model list, and prompt field. Smart focus: prompt field when configured, provider choice when not. A11Y-4 hardened.
- [x] Add `check_grammar_with_ai()` command — sends selection or full document to AI; uses `ai_prompt_default_model` setting (falls back to `ai_chat_default_model`). Runs off UI thread.
- [x] Add AI Prompt Library (`quill/core/prompt_library.py`) with 12 built-in prompts, full CRUD, enable/disable, per-prompt optional shortcut, and `.pqp` import/export.
- [x] Add Prompt Library dialog (`quill/ui/prompt_library_dialog.py`) — searchable list, run with AI, new/edit/delete prompts, import/export `.pqp`.
- [x] Add `ai_prompt_default_model` setting in `Preferences > AI`.
- [x] Add bundled Quillin `ai-writing-prompts` with 7 prompts contributed to the Prompt Library at load time (no capability declaration needed; prompts.json sidecar pattern).
- [x] Add `install_extension()` to `quill/core/quillins/loader.py` with path-containment enforcement.
- [x] Add Install from Folder button to Quillin Manager; uses `wx.DirDialog` + `install_extension()`.
- [x] Add `.pqp` (Prompt Quill Pack) file format: `{"schema": "quill.prompt-pack/1", "name": "...", "prompts": [...]}`.
- [x] API keys stored exclusively in Windows Credential Manager (`quill-openrouter-api-key`, `quill-openai-api-key`, `quill-ollama-api-key`); never in `settings.json`.
- [x] Add `.sqp` (Skill Quill Pack) file format: `quill.skill/1` schema; YAML front matter + Markdown steps; parameters, condition branching, output blocks, use-prompt/use-skill delegation.
- [x] Add `quill/core/skill_pack.py`: parser, validator (`validate_skill`), synchronous runner (`run_skill`); no streaming by design.
- [x] Add `quill/tools/sqp_validator.py`: CLI validator with `--strict` mode.
- [x] Add bundled `ai-writing-skills` Quillin with 4 sample skills (Accessible Rewrite, Research and Draft, Meeting Notes to Action Items, Argument Strengthener).
- [x] Add `tests/unit/core/test_skill_pack.py`: 23 tests covering parsing, validation, runner, condition branching, depth limit, and all bundled files.
- [x] Add `quill/platform/windows/credential_store.py`: unified credential access with env-var, portable DPAPI file, and Credential Manager backends. Activated by `QUILL_PORTABLE=1`. Update `ai_chat_dialog.py` and `assistant_ai.py` to use it.

## §22. Startup Wizard — Personalise QUILL

### §22.1 Overview

The Startup Wizard is a first-run wizard that lets every user shape QUILL to their work and accessibility needs before the main frame appears. It is also re-runnable at any time via Help > Personalise QUILL. Features the user disables are completely hidden — no menus, no commands, no phantom shortcuts.

The wizard is a `wx.adv.Wizard` subclass with nine `wx.adv.WizardPageSimple` pages. Every page announces its heading via a live region on `EVT_WIZARD_PAGE_CHANGED`. Focus on page change lands on the first interactive control. Show/hide of conditional sub-sections uses `sizer.Show()` + `Layout()` so no hidden control can receive keyboard focus.

### §22.2 The Nine Pages

1. **Welcome** — introductory text; no configuration.
2. **Keyboard and Sound** — QUILL key (Caps Lock / Insert / None), sound effects, and (conditional) interface language selector when `.mo` files are present.
3. **AI Writing Assistance** — enable/disable AI; if enabled, choose provider (OpenAI, OpenRouter, Ollama, Set up later), API key or Ollama host, and default model.
4. **Remote File Editing** — enable/disable SSH/SFTP; optional inline site-entry form (friendly name, host, port, username).
5. **QUILL Extensions (Quillins)** — enable/disable Quillin support; option to auto-install bundled extensions; read-only list of bundled Quillins.
6. **Power Tools** — enable/disable the Power Tools menu and commands.
7. **Notebook Workspace** — enable/disable multi-document notebook mode.
8. **Keyboard Profile** — choose a starting keyboard profile (QUILL Default, Minimal, Screen Reader Friendly) from profiles scanned in `quill/core/keymap/`.
9. **Summary and Finish** — read-only two-column list of every decision made in pages 2-8; Finish writes settings atomically.

### §22.3 Feature Gating via FeatureManager

`quill/core/feature_flags.py` defines a frozen `FeatureFlags` dataclass and `is_enabled(flag: str) -> bool`. The wizard writes a `feature_flags` block into `settings.json` via `write_json_atomic`. `MainFrame.__init__` loads flags before building menus, the command registry, and keybindings.

The two network-capable gated features are:

- `core.remote` — SSH/SFTP remote editing. When disabled, the Remote menu and all SSH commands are absent.
- `future.ai` — AI writing assistance. When disabled, Ask Quill, Prompt Library, Skill Library, grammar check, and all AI commands are absent.

Commands with `feature_tag = None` are always present (core editing). Commands whose tag is disabled are excluded from the command palette search and their keyboard bindings are not registered, so `Ctrl+?` discovery shows no ghost shortcuts.

### §22.4 First-Run Detection and Re-run

`setup_wizard_completed` in `settings.json` (type bool, default False) controls first-run detection. When the field is absent or False, `MainFrame.__init__` runs `run_setup_wizard(parent=None)` before any UI is shown, then reloads settings before building menus.

Re-run opens the wizard in update mode with all pages pre-filled. Changed flags trigger `_apply_feature_flags()`, which rebuilds the affected menu groups, refreshes the command palette, re-applies the keymap profile, and announces the change — no restart required.

### §22.5 Settings Additions

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `setup_wizard_completed` | bool | False | Suppresses wizard on next launch |
| `feature_flags_ai` | bool | True | Master switch for all AI features |
| `feature_flags_remote` | bool | True | Master switch for remote editing |
| `feature_flags_quillins` | bool | True | Master switch for Quillins |
| `feature_flags_power_tools` | bool | True | Master switch for Power Tools |
| `feature_flags_notebook` | bool | True | Master switch for Notebook workspace |
| `keymap_profile` | str | "default" | Active keyboard profile name |

### §22.6 Implementation Status

**SHIPPED.** Phases 1-3 complete: `setup_wizard.py`, `setup_wizard_pages.py`, `feature_flags.py`, `feature_registry.py`, and `check_feature_tags.py` CI gate are all in production. Phase 4 (additional keymap profiles beyond the shipped defaults) is in progress.

## §23. Context-Sensitive Help System

### §23.1 Overview

QUILL provides three help keystrokes that give the user immediate, contextual assistance without leaving the keyboard:

| Key | Command | Behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| F1 | Help on This Control | Shows a small dialog describing the focused control |
| Ctrl+F1 | Open User Guide | Opens docs/html/USER_GUIDE.html in the system browser |
| Shift+F1 | What Can I Do Here? | Document-type context report (enhanced) |

`F1` always returns something useful. There are three fallback levels: (1) named schema topic via `ctrl.GetName()`, (2) generic description by `ctrl.GetClassName()`, (3) control name + tooltip + prompt to open the User Guide.

### §23.2 Architecture

```
quill/core/help/topics.json          schema: topic id, title, body, keystrokes, user_guide_section
quill/core/help/renderer.py          render_live(), render_doc(), generate_markdown()
quill/ui/context_help.py             ContextHelpDialog, ContextHelpMixin, describe_focused()
quill/tools/build_docs.py            generates docs/CONTROL_REFERENCE.md from topics.json
quill/tools/check_help_coverage.py   CI gate: stale entries fail; coverage gaps warn
```

Topic IDs are derived from `ctrl.GetName()`. Dialog controls are prefixed with the dialog's accessible name: `connect_to_ssh_server.host_or_ip_address`. This works because the dialog contract already requires every interactive control to carry a meaningful `SetName()`.

`ContextHelpMixin` is added to `MainFrame`'s MRO. It tracks the last-focused control via `EVT_CHILD_FOCUS` so that navigating to `Help > Help on This Control` via the menu bar still describes the correct control.

### §23.3 ContextHelpDialog Screen-Reader Design

The dialog contains a single read-only `wx.TextCtrl` (multi-line, no border, dialog background colour) with combined title and body text, plus a Close button. Using one TextCtrl means NVDA reads the dialog title then the entire content line by line on open, without the user tabbing between controls first. Focus lands on the TextCtrl. Closing the dialog restores focus to the described control.

The dialog is registered in `dialog_inventory.json`. `affirmative_id = wx.ID_CLOSE`. Escape also closes it.

### §23.4 Topics Coverage

The schema (`quill/core/help/topics.json`) currently contains 109 topics covering:

- Main editor surface, status bar, document tabs
- All major dialogs: Find/Replace, Spell Check, AI Assistant, Remote/SSH, Preferences pages
- Startup Wizard pages (F1 on any wizard control explains the effect of each choice)
- Feature profiles, keyboard packs, read-aloud settings, GLOW workflows

Full coverage target is 250 topics (all `SetName()` calls in `quill/ui/`).

### §23.5 CI Gate

`quill/tools/check_help_coverage.py` enforces two rules:

- **Blocking:** A topic ID in `topics.json` has no matching `SetName()` call in `quill/ui/`. Stale entries describe UI that no longer exists.
- **Warning (non-blocking until `--strict`):** A `SetName()` call in `quill/ui/` has no matching topic. Coverage gap printed to stdout during the authoring sprint.

### §23.6 Implementation Status

**SHIPPED.** Phase A (infrastructure: `topics.json`, `renderer.py`, `context_help.py`, F1/Ctrl+F1/Shift+F1 wiring) complete. Phase B (schema authoring sprint, 109 of 250 topics complete) in progress. Phase D (coverage gate) complete. Phases C (documentation HTML build) and E (user guide restructure) in progress.

## §24. Translation and Community Localization

### §24.1 Overview

QUILL uses GNU gettext for all user-visible strings, with Babel for POT extraction and Crowdin for community translation management. The design follows the NV Access NVDA translation model, which has produced high-quality, screen-reader-tested translations across 50+ languages.

Speech announcement strings are first-class translation targets. They are marked with `#. SPEECH:` extracted comments in the POT file so translators can filter them for review and test them with a native screen reader in the target language.

### §24.2 Pipeline

```
quill/core/i18n.py          _(), ngettext(), lazy_gettext(), init_locale()
babel.cfg                   Babel extraction configuration
quill/locale/quill.pot      Master string template (auto-generated by pybabel extract)
quill/locale/{lang}/LC_MESSAGES/quill.po   Per-language translation (community, via Crowdin)
quill/locale/{lang}/LC_MESSAGES/quill.mo   Compiled binary (generated by pybabel compile)
quill/tools/check_translation.py           CI gate
```

`init_locale()` is called in `MainFrame.__init__` before any UI string. The `language` setting (BCP 47 tag, default empty = OS locale) controls the active locale. The startup wizard's Page 2 shows a language selector when more than one `.mo` file is present.

### §24.3 Crowdin Components

Three Crowdin components manage translation content:

1. **UI strings** — source `quill/locale/quill.pot`, target `quill/locale/{lang}/LC_MESSAGES/quill.po`
2. **Context-sensitive help** — source `quill/core/help/topics.json`, target `quill/core/help/topics_{lang}.json`
3. **Quillin manifests** — source each bundled `manifest.json`, target `manifest_{lang}.json`

Auto-PR on approved translation; PRs land on `main` after the CI gate passes.

### §24.4 Four-Tier Role Model

| Role | Responsibilities |
|---|---|
| Translator | Suggests translations in Crowdin |
| Proofreader | Approves or rejects suggestions for their language |
| Language Coordinator | Manages proofreaders, owns language quality, reviews PRs |
| Translation Coordinator | Project-level; runs translation calls, onboards teams, resolves disputes |

The Translation Coordinator is a named maintainer role in `MAINTAINERS.md`.

### §24.5 Language Priority

- **Tier 1 (target: ship with QUILL 1.0):** French (fr), German (de), Spanish (es)
- **Tier 2 (close follow-on):** Portuguese/Brazilian Portuguese (pt_BR), Japanese (ja), Italian (it)
- **Tier 3 (RTL, requires layout work):** Arabic (ar), Hebrew (he)

Completeness thresholds: 90% for established languages, 70% for a language's first release. Languages below threshold are excluded from that release's language selector.

### §24.6 CI Gate

`quill/tools/check_translation.py` checks: POT currency (dry-run pybabel extract + diff), completeness threshold per language, mnemonic `&` preservation, placeholder `{n}` / `%(count)s` preservation, and no empty translated strings.

### §24.7 Implementation Status

**Phase 1 infrastructure complete:** `quill/core/i18n.py`, `babel.cfg`, `check_translation.py` gate, `language` setting, and `init_locale()` call are all in production. **Phase 2 (string marking sprint)** is in progress — sweeping all user-visible strings in `quill/ui/` and `quill/core/` to wrap them with `_()`. Pilot languages (fr, de, es) are pending community formation and a named Translation Coordinator.

## §25. GitHub Remote File Access

### §25.1 Overview

QUILL provides first-class GitHub repository browsing, remote file opening, and file commit-back through **File > Open from Remote > GitHub Repository...** This lets users open files from any public or private GitHub repository without requiring the GitHub CLI, GitHub Desktop, local Git, VS Code, or command-line interaction.

The implementation uses **PyGithub** behind QUILL's own `RemoteProvider` abstraction (`quill/core/github/provider.py`), which keeps the UI layer stable if the backend changes (e.g. direct REST, GitLab, Bitbucket).

### §25.2 Menu Structure

Added to the existing **File > Open from Remote** submenu:

```
File > Open from Remote
  ...FTP / SFTP / WebDAV / S3 items (existing)...
  ---
  GitHub Repository...
  GitHub File URL...
  Save to GitHub...
  ---
  Manage Remote Sites...   (existing)
  Manage GitHub Accounts...
```

All four GitHub commands are also available through the Command Palette.

### §25.3 Feature Flag

Feature ID: `core.github_remote`  
Category: `core`  
Privacy: `network after confirmation`  
Dependencies: `core.remote`  
Optional dep: `pip install "quill[github]"` (installs PyGithub >= 2.0)

When the flag is off, all four GitHub menu items are absent. When PyGithub is not installed, QUILL shows a friendly message with the install command.

### §25.4 Authentication

**First-run consent.** The first time the user opens a GitHub feature, a one-time consent dialog explains that QUILL will connect to api.github.com for the user's chosen repositories. Consent is stored in `github_consent.json` in the user data directory.

**Anonymous access.** Public repositories are browsable without a token. Rate limits are lower (60 requests/hour vs 5,000 with auth).

**Personal Access Token.** The user pastes a token with at minimum `public_repo` scope (add `repo` for private repositories). The token is stored in **Windows Credential Manager** under the target name `quill-github-token` using DPAPI. Never stored in `settings.json` or any plaintext file.

**Token management.** File > Open from Remote > Manage GitHub Accounts... lets the user view the stored identity, add/replace the token, and sign out (deletes the stored token).

### §25.5 Repository Browser

A native `wx.Dialog` with:

- **Account label** (signed-in identity or "Anonymous").
- **Repository field** (`owner/repo` text entry) + **Load** button. Enter key also triggers Load.
- **Branch/tag choice** (populated after Load; defaults to the repository's default branch).
- **Current path label** (breadcrumb).
- **File list** (`wx.ListCtrl`, single-select, columns: Name / Type / Size). Directories appear first, sorted A-Z; files follow, sorted A-Z.
- **Status label** (loading state, error messages, item count).
- **Buttons**: Open File, Go Up, Refresh, Copy URL, Cancel.

Keyboard shortcuts:
- Enter on a folder: navigates into it.
- Enter on a file: same as Open File.
- Backspace: go up one level (when not at root).
- F5: refresh.

All controls have accessible names. Long operations (repository load, directory listing, file fetch) run on daemon threads; the dialog remains interactive during loading.

### §25.6 GitHub File URL

**File > Open from Remote > GitHub File URL...** accepts a pasted `https://github.com/owner/repo/blob/branch/path` URL and opens the file directly without requiring the user to navigate the browser. Useful for sharing links.

### §25.7 Save to GitHub

**File > Open from Remote > Save to GitHub...** is available when the active document was opened from GitHub. QUILL prompts for a commit message, then commits the current document text to the same repository, branch, and path using the GitHub API (`update_file`). The file SHA is tracked for optimistic concurrency; if the file has changed remotely since it was opened, GitHub returns a 409 and QUILL shows a clear error.

Requirements: the stored token must have `repo` (write) scope on the target repository.

This command is intentionally not wired to the regular Save shortcut. The user must invoke it explicitly from the menu or Command Palette to avoid accidental commits.

### §25.8 Remote Origin Metadata

When a file is opened from GitHub, QUILL stores a `RemoteOrigin` dataclass keyed by the local temp path:

```python
RemoteOrigin(
    provider="github",
    account_id="github:login",
    repository="owner/repo",
    ref="main",
    path="docs/example.md",
    sha="abc123...",
    url="https://github.com/owner/repo/blob/main/docs/example.md",
    opened_at="2026-06-12T..."
)
```

The tab's `source_label` is set to `GitHub: owner/repo (branch)` and shown in the title bar.

### §25.9 Security Properties

- No network access until the user explicitly opens a GitHub feature and accepts the consent dialog.
- Tokens stored via DPAPI; never logged, never in diagnostic bundles.
- File size limit: 1 MB (GitHub API limit for the contents endpoint). Files exceeding this are rejected with a clear error.
- Save-back requires explicit user action and a commit message.
- No silent background syncing or polling.

### §25.11 Implementation Status

**SHIPPED** (2026-06-12). All five implementation phases complete:
- Phase 1: Core service layer and models.
- Phase 2: Authentication (token + anonymous).
- Phase 3: Repository browser dialog.
- Phase 4: Remote document integration (origin metadata, title, save-back).
- Phase 5: Gate compliance (banned patterns, dialog inventory, module size budget, mypy overrides).
