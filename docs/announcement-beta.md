## Why this matters

Quill 0.1.2 Beta is not a narrow patch. It is a broad capability release that makes Quill viable for:

- daily writing and editing
- markup-heavy technical authoring
- accessibility review and deterministic cleanup
- complex import and conversion workflows
- revision and comparison-heavy editing
- local-first AI-assisted drafting and refinement

## Translation process and community effort

QUILL's localization direction is community-first and modeled on a gettext catalog workflow (`POT -> PO -> MO`). The project is building translation as a release discipline, not as an afterthought.

For contributors, translation work starts with GitHub pull requests against locale catalogs and clear translator comments. As the contributor base grows, QUILL will add a dedicated translation portal flow while keeping gettext catalogs as the source of truth.

The contributor plan, release cadence, quality gates, and translator expectations live in the new planning doc:

- [QUILL Translation Contributor Plan](localization/translation-contributor-plan.md)

## What is still in beta

Quill is still a beta release, which means:

- some workflows are deeper than others
- some integrations depend on optional local tools
- behavior can still be tuned based on real-world feedback

But the feature surface is already substantial and practical for real work.

## How to get the most from 0.1.2

1. Start with the user guide to pick workflows that match your daily work.
2. Use the command palette to discover features quickly.
3. Try one advanced workflow at a time: compare, preview, GLOW, or assistant.
4. Report rough edges with diagnostics so the next release can harden where it matters most.

Quill 0.1.2 Beta is ready for serious use, and this release is intentionally built to make the full capability surface visible instead of hidden.
