# Quill User Guide

**QUILL** stands for **Quality, Usable, Inclusive, Lightweight, Literate**.

**QUILL: A quality, usable, inclusive, lightweight, and literate editor built for everyone who writes, codes, learns, and creates.**

Quill is a screen-reader-first writing and reading environment for Windows. It is designed to feel calm, predictable, deeply keyboard-friendly, and respectful of your focus. It is also ambitious. Quill is not only a place to write plain text. It is a place to open difficult documents, inspect structure, navigate long material, compare revisions, prepare content for Markdown or HTML, and work with accessibility and extraction issues without leaving the editor.

This guide is aligned to Quill 0.5.0 Beta, built by Blind Information Technology Solutions (BITS) together with Community Access.

This guide is written as a companion, not a reference wall. Read it from the beginning if you are new to Quill. Dip into the sections that matter most if you already know what kind of work you want to do.

Quill is also in beta. Expect polish, depth, and real daily utility. Also expect rough edges, unfinished flows, and the occasional surprise. If you find something confusing or broken, that is useful information. Quill is becoming stronger because real people are trying it on real work.

## Start Here

If you only have five minutes, do this:

1. The first time QUILL starts, the **Personalise QUILL** wizard offers to set up your keyboard layout, profile, and optional features in about two minutes. Complete it or dismiss it; you can re-run it from **Help → Personalise QUILL** at any time.
2. Press `Ctrl+N` to create a new document, or press `Ctrl+O` to open one.
3. Type a few lines.
4. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` to open the Command Palette. Type `guide`, `spell`, `compare`, or `glow` and notice how quickly Quill turns intent into action.
5. Press `F6` to move into the status bar and hear how Quill treats even the bottom of the window as a working surface.
6. Press `F7` for spell check, `Ctrl+F` to search, or `Ctrl+K` to insert a link.
7. Press `F1` on any control to hear what it does and see its keyboard shortcuts.

If you ever feel lost, press `F1` for immediate help on the focused control, or use **Help → What Can I Do Here?** for document-context guidance. Think of those commands as the editor quietly putting a mentor beside you.

## What Quill Feels Like

Quill is built around a few promises.

- The keyboard is never second-class.
- Screen readers are not an afterthought.
- Every major action is reachable from the menu, the palette, and the command system.
- Documents open locally and stay local unless you explicitly choose a network-aware action.
- The editor should tell you what changed, where you are, and what is possible next.

In practice, that means Quill spends a lot of attention on focus movement, meaningful status updates, discoverable commands, and native Windows controls. It also means Quill tries to reduce fear. When you open a recovered draft, compare two files, inspect extraction quality, or apply a deterministic GLOW fix, the point is not to feel clever. The point is to feel safe.

## Your First Session

Imagine your first meaningful visit to Quill.

You launch the app. There is no splash screen. The window appears quickly, with a menu bar, an editor, and a status bar. If Quill detects a screen reader, it adjusts its hints and announcement style. If Quill notices an earlier crash or autosave state, it offers recovery instead of silently hoping you forgot.

From there, a natural first session looks like this:

1. Open a file with `Ctrl+O` or create one with `Ctrl+N`.
2. Read or write in the editor.
3. Use `Ctrl+Shift+P` to explore commands without memorizing everything.
4. Use the **Navigate** menu to jump by line, heading, block, region, or page.
5. Use the **Tools** menu for spelling, word count, extraction review, compare, macros, regex help, and GLOW workflows.
6. Open **Help → Open Keyboard Reference** to see the exact shortcuts that exist in your current configuration, including your keyboard pack and any custom bindings.

That first session matters because it teaches the most important Quill habit: you do not need to hunt. If an action exists, Quill wants you to be able to reach it from where you already are.

## Getting Around QUILL

QUILL is designed so you never need to memorize an action to reach it.

### F1 — help on the focused control

Press `F1` on any focusable control — a dialog field, a button, a menu item, the editor itself — and a small help dialog opens. It tells you what the control does and what keyboard shortcuts apply to it. The full text lands in one read-only field so your screen reader announces everything in one pass when the dialog opens.

- `F1` — help on the focused control
- `Ctrl+F1` — open the full User Guide
- `Shift+F1` — open "What Can I Do Here?" for the active document context

See [Context-Sensitive Help (F1)](#context-sensitive-help-f1) for full details.

### The QUILL key

The **QUILL key** is `Ctrl+Shift+Grave` (the back-tick/grave key above Tab). It is the one prefix chord that opens most of QUILL's power features without ever leaving the keyboard. Press it once and QUILL arms a one-shot prefix that listens for a second key. Press it twice and QUILL **locks** Quick Nav mode on until you press `Esc`. The QUILL key is its own tiny language: every chord is announced, every chord is remappable in **Preferences → Keyboard**, and the full cheat sheet is one keystroke away (`Ctrl+Shift+Grave, ?`).

Common QUILL-key chords:

- `Ctrl+Shift+Grave, N` — enter Quick Nav (browse) mode for the next action. If the `browse_mode_sticky` setting is on, the mode stays locked until `Esc`; otherwise it expires on the QUILL-key timeout. Press the QUILL key again (without a chord) to lock it on regardless of the setting.
- `Ctrl+Shift+Grave` (pressed twice) — lock Quick Nav mode on until `Esc`. This is the most common path: first press arms the prefix, second press locks browse mode.
- `Ctrl+Shift+Grave, G` — open **Go to Anything** (Quick Nav search).
- `Ctrl+Shift+Grave, M` — paste the rich HTML clipboard as Markdown at the cursor.
- `Ctrl+Shift+Grave, Shift+O` — open from remote (FTP / SFTP / HTTPS / WebDAV / S3 / GitHub).
- `Ctrl+Shift+Grave, W` — save to remote.
- `Ctrl+Shift+Grave, Shift+M` — manage saved remote sites.
- `Ctrl+Shift+Grave, A` — selection actions when text is selected (also expands an abbreviation manually mid-word).
- `Ctrl+Shift+Grave, Shift+A` — open the abbreviation manager.
- `Ctrl+Shift+Grave, E` — toggle abbreviation expansion on or off.
- `Ctrl+Shift+Grave, X` — open the Copy Tray dialog.
- `Ctrl+Shift+Grave, Shift+1`–`Shift+9`, `Shift+0`, `Shift+-`, `Shift+=` — copy the selection to slots 1–12 of the Copy Tray.
- `Ctrl+Shift+Grave, ?` — show the QUILL key cheat sheet.
- `Ctrl+Shift+Grave, Esc` — cancel the prefix without firing any command.

### Command Palette

`Ctrl+Shift+P` opens the Command Palette — a searchable list of every registered command. Type any part of a command name to filter. Press Enter to run it. This is the fastest way to reach any action without memorizing its key or menu path. Searching `guide`, `spell`, `compare`, or `glow` from the palette is a good first practice.

### Navigation anchors

The status bar (`F6` to focus it) is a working surface, not decoration. Each cell announces meaningful information and most cells open a related dialog when you press Enter or click. `Shift+F6` moves focus back to the editor.

Reach any menu from the keyboard: `Alt+F` for File, `Alt+E` for Edit, `Alt+V` for View, `Alt+T` for Tools, `Alt+H` for Help. All menu items have keyboard mnemonics.

The Navigate menu groups document-level movement: go to line, go to heading, go to entry in notebook, heading organizer, outline navigator, back and forward location history, and structural next/previous. When you need to move across a large document, start there.

## Command-Line Launching

Quill supports command-line startup options for scripted workflows and direct navigation.

Supported options:

- `--help`: show command help and exit.
- `--version`: print QUILL version and exit without launching the UI.
- `--safe-mode`: launch with optional state disabled.
- `--reset-profile`: reset feature profile store before launch.
- `--diagnostics`: start with diagnostics tracing enabled.
- `--dump-stacks`: write a thread-stack dump and exit.
- `--line N`: 1-based line for the first startup file.
- `--column M`: 1-based column for the first startup file.
- `--goto FILE[:LINE[:COL]]`: open a file at an optional 1-based line and column in one argument. This is the compact form of `--line`/`--column`, handy when an external tool (a linter, a search result, a build error) hands you a `file:line:column` string. Example: `--goto main.kt:27:5`.
- `--diff LEFT RIGHT`: open two files directly in compare mode, landing on the first difference without opening each file by hand.
- `--new-window`: force a new process instead of forwarding to an existing instance.
- `--wait`: when forwarding to an existing instance, wait for that instance to close.

Examples:

- `python -m quill --version`
- `python -m quill notes.md --line 40 --column 5`
- `python -m quill --goto main.kt:27:5`
- `python -m quill --diff old-draft.md new-draft.md`
- `python -m quill --new-window notes.md`

## The Main Window

Quill keeps its main window intentionally simple.

### Menu bar

The menu bar follows the Windows and Office order you likely expect:

- File
- Edit
- View
- Insert
- Format
- Navigate
- Search
- Tools
- Window
- Help

The menu bar is exhaustive rather than decorative. If Quill can do something, there is almost certainly a menu path for it.

### Editor surface

The editor is the heart of Quill. It is where writing happens, where extracted text lands, where reports open as ordinary tabs, and where GLOW previews and compare summaries feel like first-class documents rather than pop-ups.

The editor supports:

- plain text writing
- Markdown-aware authoring
- HTML-aware authoring
- structural navigation
- selection helpers
- text cleanup
- spell and thesaurus workflows
- link insertion and link following
- compare-driven review

### Tabs and document switching

Quill is multi-document. Each open file lives in a notebook tab. You can:

- move between documents with `Ctrl+Tab` and `Ctrl+Shift+Tab`
- close the active document with `Ctrl+W`
- use the tab context menu to close one tab, close other tabs, or close tabs to the right
- reveal a saved document in File Explorer directly from the tab context menu

Quill also opens generated artifacts as tabs. The welcome guide, keyboard reference, compare summary, GLOW audit report, and GLOW fix preview all feel like normal working tabs. That is deliberate. Artifacts should stay close to the work that created them.

### Status bar

The status bar is interactive. It is not just a strip of passive text.

Use `F6` to move into it. Once there, you can move between cells and activate them. Depending on your layout and current state, the status bar can surface:

- current message
- line and column
- word count
- insert or overwrite mode
- selection size
- encoding
- line endings
- spell-check state
- background task state
- notifications
- read-aloud state
- autosave timing
- current search term
- file path or unsaved state

You can reorder or hide status items through **Tools → Customize & Support → Status Bar Layout...**.
Right-click a focused status cell to **Activate**, **Hide this item**, or open **Status bar settings...**.
Use **Restore Defaults** in status bar settings to reset visibility and order.
When title mode is set to full path, Quill automatically hides the duplicate file-path status cell.

### Region cycling

Use `F6` and `Shift+F6` to move between major regions. Quill treats region movement as a first-class accessibility feature. If you write, inspect, and navigate entirely from the keyboard, this becomes second nature quickly.

## The Menu Bar Reference

This section walks the entire menu bar in the order you will encounter it.

### File

The **File** menu is the full document lifecycle.

- **New** creates a blank document.
- **Open...** opens a document from disk.
- **Open Recent** returns quickly to recently used files.
- **Open from URL...** downloads a document or text resource through an explicit safety flow that confirms host and expected size.
- **Open from Remote**, **Save to Remote**, **Save Copy to Remote**, and **Manage Remote Sites...** (in the *Open from Remote* submenu) open, save, and administer saved sites over **FTP, SFTP, HTTPS, WebDAV, and Amazon S3 (or any S3-compatible service)**. Each remote operation is explicit, runs over a verified TLS context, announces host and expected size, and never writes to disk before you confirm.
- **Snapshots** lets you save and reopen groups of documents as a single workspace snapshot, similar to lightweight workspaces in Visual Studio Code.
- **New from Clipboard** opens a new document seeded with the current clipboard text.
- **Save** writes the current document.
- **Save As...** writes to a new path, converting the document to the file type you choose in the dialog. Quill keeps your text as portable Markdown-style markup, so picking **Rich Text Format (\*.rtf)** writes real RTF, **HTML (\*.html)** writes a standalone web page, and **Text (\*.txt)** writes clean prose with the markup removed. Choosing **Markdown (\*.md)** keeps the markup verbatim. The file's extension always decides the format; if you type a name without an extension, the selected type supplies one. When Save As changes the format, Quill can reload the file so the editing surface matches it — for example, opening a freshly saved `.rtf` in the Rich text editor. By default it asks first with a Yes/No prompt (reloading replaces the editor contents with the saved file); set **Settings → Editing → Reload after Save As to match the format** to *Reload automatically* or *Keep current surface* to skip the prompt.
- **Save All** writes every modified open document.
- **Save As Plain Text...** exports a clean plain-text version. Because plain text has no links, **Settings → Editing → Links in plain-text export** controls how Markdown links are written: keep the link text and its URL (the default, so you never lose where a link pointed), the link text only, the URL only, or the original Markdown link. This setting also applies whenever Save As writes a `.txt` file.
- **Reload from Disk** throws away in-memory edits and reloads the file from storage after confirmation.
- **Restore Backup...** lets you restore a saved backup version.
- **Page Setup...** and **Print...** support paper and print workflows.
- **Run Current File** executes the saved file with its associated tool, and **Open Target at Cursor** opens the path or link under the caret.
- **Rename Current File...** and **Delete Current File...** manage the file on disk from inside the editor.
- **Close Document** closes the current tab.
- **Exit** closes the application.

The File menu is also where Quill quietly proves that it respects risk. Reload is explicit. Backup restore is explicit. URL opening is explicit. Nothing important is hidden behind a side effect.

### Edit

The **Edit** menu is where writing muscles live.

Standard clipboard commands are here:

- Undo
- Redo
- Cut
- Copy
- Paste
- Copy With Source
- Select All

Quill then goes further with selection- and navigation-aware editing:

- **Find...**, **Replace...**, **Find Next**, **Find Previous**, and **Find All Matches** all live here. Replace includes a **Replace All** action in its dialog, so bulk replacement stays in one place.
- **Word Prediction...** opens inline word and tag suggestions.
- **Extend Selection Mode** turns selection growth into a dedicated mode.
- **Selection** submenu includes Select Line, Select Paragraph, Select Block, Select to Start or End of Line, Select to Start or End of Document, and a nested **Recent Marks (Ring)** group (set a temporary mark, jump to previous marks, swap cursor and mark, list recent marks).
- **Follow Link** opens the link under the caret. (Link *insertion* now lives in the **Insert** menu.)
- **Paste HTML as Markdown** converts rich clipboard HTML to Markdown as it pastes.
- The deletion group — **Delete to Line Start**, **Delete to Line End**, **Delete to Document Top**, **Delete to Document Bottom**, and **Delete Paragraph** — removes text relative to the cursor.

**Preferences...** and **Customize Menus...** live with the rest of Quill's configuration under **Tools -> Customize & Support**.

### View

The **View** menu controls how Quill presents your document on screen without changing your content.

- **Toggle Soft Wrap** changes line wrapping without modifying the file.
- **Auto Side-by-Side Preview** opens a live preview beside the editor automatically.
- **Show Tab Control** toggles the visible document tab strip.
- **Wrap Find Searches** controls whether Find wraps past the end of the document.
- **Start With No Document Open** makes Quill open into an empty workspace instead of a starter document.
- **Preview...**, **Preview Side by Side**, **Focus Preview**, and **Browser Preview...** open rendered views of the current document.

Preference-style toggles that used to live here — theme/dark mode, system-tray mode, title-bar path style, dirty-title style, persistent undo, spell-check-as-you-type, and word-prediction-as-you-type — now live in the registry-driven **Settings** dialog (**Tools -> Customize & Support -> Preferences...**), where they are persisted in one place.

### Insert

The **Insert** menu adds structured content at the cursor.

- **Insert Link...** creates a format-aware link.
- **Heading** submenu: insert Heading 1 through 6, **Decrease Level** / **Increase Level**, and **Style Headings...** (font, size, alignment) for the current level or all levels.
- **List** submenu: **Bullet**, **Numbered**, **Task**, and **List Manager...**.
- **Insert Code Block**, **Insert Footnote**, **Insert Table...**, **Insert HTML Tag...**, and **Insert Markdown Tag...**.
- **Insert Snippet...** and **Manage Snippets...** for reusable text with placeholders.
- **Special Character...**, **Date and Time** submenu, and **File Content...** insert symbols, timestamps (date, time, and date and time), and the contents of another file. The **Date and Time** submenu is provided by the bundled `com.quill.bundled.insert-tools` Quillin.

Quill treats Markdown and HTML as working surfaces, not special-purpose export formats, so tag insertion lives here beside the structural inserts.

#### Word prediction and snippets

Quill separates live prediction from snippet insertion so the hotkeys feel like a modern editor:

1. Press `Ctrl+.` to open **Word Prediction** (also on **Edit -> Word Prediction...**).
2. Type to surface matching document words, HTML tags, and Markdown tags.
3. Use arrow keys to choose a result and press Enter to insert it.

For setup and maintenance:

- Press `Ctrl+Shift+Grave, S` for **Insert Snippet**.
- Press `Ctrl+Shift+Grave, Shift+S` for **Manage Snippets** (create, edit, delete, import, export, and starter packs).
- Open **Preferences -> Install Starter Snippet Packs** to install sample libraries for daily writing, developer flow, and support/accessibility notes.
- In **General Preferences**, toggle **Word prediction and tag IntelliSense** or **Expand snippet triggers while typing** as needed.

Snippets support placeholders such as `${input:name}`, `${choice:a|b}`, `${date}`, `${time}`, and `${cursor}`.

### Format

The **Format** menu handles presentation and markup-aware editing of existing text.

Case operations live in the **Change Case** submenu:

- Upper Case
- Lower Case
- Title Case
- Sentence Case
- Toggle Case

Comment and indentation tools:

- Toggle Line Comment
- Toggle Block Comment
- Indent
- Outdent

Line operations:

- Move Line Up
- Move Line Down
- Duplicate Line
- Delete Line
- Join Lines

Inline emphasis:

- Bold
- Italic

The **Transform Lines** submenu gathers every line and text transform in one place: **Number Lines...**, **Hard-Wrap Lines...**, **Sort Lines Ascending**, **Sort Lines Descending**, **Reverse Lines**, **Remove Duplicate Lines**, **Trim Trailing Whitespace**, **Normalize Whitespace**, **Convert Indentation to Spaces**, and **Convert Indentation to Tabs**.

### Navigate

The **Navigate** menu is one of Quill's strongest differentiators. It assumes you may need to move through large, dense, or extracted material without visual scanning.

Core location commands:

- **Go To Line...**
- **Go To Page...**
- **Back Location**
- **Forward Location**

Structural movement commands:

- **Next Heading**
- **Previous Heading**
- **Next Block**
- **Previous Block**
- **Outline Navigator...**
- **Heading Organizer...** (`Ctrl+Shift+Grave, O`) for heading-level edits, section reorder, and heading validation
- **Match Bracket**
- **Next Structure**
- **Previous Structure**
- **Next Region**
- **Previous Region**

Bookmark and position commands:

- **Set Bookmark...**
- **Go To Bookmark...**
- **List Bookmarks...**
- **Go to Percent...**
- **First Non-Blank**
- **Last Non-Blank**

If your work involves transcripts, legal text, long Markdown notes, HTML source, or extracted PDFs, spend time here. This is the menu that turns Quill from a text box into a navigable workspace. (Find Next, Find Previous, and Find All Matches now live in **Edit**, beside Find and Replace.)

### Search

The **Search** menu is the across-files and pattern hub. In-document Find and Replace live in **Edit**; this menu covers multi-file and regular-expression work.

- **Search in Files...** and **Replace Across Files...** search and replace across a folder of documents.
- **Count Regex Matches...** and **Extract Regex Matches...** report or pull out every match of a regular expression.
- **Lines in First Block Only** and **Lines Common to Both Blocks** filter lines by block membership (set operations between two marked blocks).

### Tools

The **Tools** menu is Quill's workshop. It contains high-value actions that are not best understood as raw editing.

#### Discovery and command access

- **Command Palette...**

The palette is one of the fastest ways to learn Quill. It supports query modes:

- normal search or `>` for general command search
- `:` to search command IDs
- `?` to favor bound commands
- `~` to emphasize recently used commands

The palette also learns from usage. Commands you use more often rise naturally.

#### Writing and language

- **Word Count...**
- **Spell Check...**
- **Next Misspelling**
- **Thesaurus...**
- **Dictionary Status...**
- **AI Hub...**
- **Writing Assistant...**
- **Prompt Studio...**
- **Agent Center...**
- **Rewrite Selection**
- **Summarize Selection**
- **Continue Writing**
- **Fix Grammar**
- **Run Python...**

The Writing Assistant shell ranks Quill commands from your prompt, offers preset prompts for rewrite/summarize/continue/grammar flows, and Run Python executes a sandboxed transform against the current document text and selection. Prompt Studio lets you build reusable custom prompts with template variables, and Agent Center generates guided task plans that you can review before sending to the Writing Assistant.

The quick writing actions work with or without a selection:

- **Rewrite Selection** and **Fix Grammar** act on your selection if you have one; otherwise they use the paragraph at the cursor.
- **Summarize Selection** acts on your selection if you have one; otherwise it summarizes the whole document.
- **Continue Writing** uses your selection as the lead-in if you have one; otherwise it continues from the full document.
- Quill announces the scope it chose, for example "Rewrite paragraph (42 words)", so you always know what the action will change.
- If there is nothing to act on, Quill says so (for example "Nothing to rewrite") instead of sending an empty request.
- If AI is turned off, these actions announce "AI is turned off. Enable 'Use Artificial Intelligence' in Tools > AI Assistant." and do nothing else.

Use **Tools -> AI Assistant -> AI Hub...** for a single control surface that links provider verification, model discovery, Prompt Studio, Agent Center, and Writing Assistant.

Trust and privacy baseline:

- On first run, Quill shows a trust and privacy consent acknowledgement.
- Quill does not persist AI chat session transcripts by default.
- Cloud requests happen only when you explicitly invoke an AI action.
- API keys are stored in Windows Credential Manager when available, with DPAPI-encrypted fallback storage.

AI connection flow:

1. Open **AI Hub** and choose provider (`Ollama (local)`, `Ollama Cloud`, `OpenAI`, `Claude`, `OpenRouter`, `Google Gemini`, or `Custom OpenAI-compatible`).
2. Confirm host URL and model.
3. Enter key only when your endpoint requires authentication.
4. Use **Verify Connection** to test endpoint and credentials.
5. Use **List Models** to fetch endpoint models, then use the search box to filter quickly.
6. Use **Recommend Model** to pick a model profile aligned to your hardware/task framing.
7. Save settings. Quill auto-runs verification and updates the AI status line in Tools > AI Assistant.

Most cloud providers are pre-configured with default host URLs so setup is key-first, not URL-first. For advanced OpenAI-compatible endpoints, use Custom and override host/model explicitly.

Quill stores optional keys in the Windows Credential Manager, with a DPAPI-encrypted file as a fallback, and announces the verification result in plain language for immediate screen-reader feedback.

Connection status messages tell you exactly what to do next:

- "Authentication failed. Check your API key." means the key was rejected (HTTP 401). Re-enter the key.
- "Access denied. Your API key is valid but lacks permission for this model or region." means the key works but is not allowed for that model, region, or billing tier (HTTP 403). Check the provider's model access, billing, or quota.
- "The AI provider is warming up. Try again in a moment." means the model is still loading. Quill retries briefly on its own before reporting this.
- "The local AI server is not running. Start Ollama and try again." means Quill could not reach your local endpoint.
- "Rate limited by the AI provider. Wait a moment and try again." means you sent requests too quickly.
- "Your saved API key could not be unlocked on this device. Open AI Connection and enter the key again." appears in the AI status line when a saved key cannot be decrypted, which can happen after moving a portable install to a different Windows account or machine. Open AI Connection and re-enter the key.

For policy details, see the repository's `PRIVACY.md` and `RESPONSIBLE_AI_USE.md`.

These help you stay inside the editor instead of breaking flow for small writing chores.

### Ask Quill Chat setup (on-device AI)

Ask Quill Chat (`Tools -> AI Assistant -> Ask Quill Chat...`) is a message-style assistant that can answer, draft text, propose edits, and run Quill commands with approval before changes are applied.

Runtime backends:

- Windows and Linux: `llama.cpp` (`llama-cpp-python`, GGUF model)
- macOS (Apple Silicon, macOS 26+): Apple Foundation Models

Setup:

1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Put a `.gguf` model in `%APPDATA%\\Quill\\models\\` (Windows) or set `QUILL_LLAMA_MODEL` to a full path.
3. Open `Tools -> AI Assistant -> Ask Quill Chat...` and send a prompt.

Accessibility:

- The whole conversation renders as an accessible WebView document: each turn is a heading (speaker) you can jump between, new replies are announced automatically, and the message box lives inside the page. Press `Escape` to close the chat. Verified in NVDA, JAWS, and VoiceOver.
- You can also connect optional providers (Ollama local/cloud, or a custom endpoint) instead of the on-device model.

Choosing the provider and model from the chat:

- A bar at the top of Ask Quill always shows the **active provider and model** so you know what is answering.
- Select **Change provider or model** to reveal the inline picker. Choose a provider and model, enter a key if needed, and **Save** — this also sets that choice as the default, so the next chat uses it.

Putting chat content into your document:

- The **Insert into document** controls at the bottom let you drop chat content straight into the editor.
- Choose the **scope** — **Last response** or **Entire transcript** — and the **format** — **Plain text**, **Markdown**, or **HTML** — then select **Insert**. The whole transcript includes the speaker labels; the last response is inserted as just its content.
- **Copy Last Response** copies the most recent reply to the clipboard.

Behavior notes:

- The assistant answers in chat by default; greetings and questions are never turned into document edits.
- Proposed actions (insert, replace, run a command) use an explicit `Approve` or `Discard` step before anything changes your document.
- If model/runtime is unavailable, Quill reports this clearly and does not apply destructive changes.
- **Train Writing Style** (`Tools -> AI Assistant -> Train Writing Style...`) lets you teach the assistant your own writing style from samples or the current document.

### The AI Hub (one place to configure every provider)

The **AI Hub** is now the single place to set up and manage AI. The former
separate **AI Model and Connection** and **Forget API Key** menu items were
merged into it, so there is one home for providers, models, keys, and testing.
Open it from `Tools -> AI Assistant -> AI Hub...`.

The Hub lets you work through every provider, each with its own key and default
model — switching providers never loses another provider's configuration:

1. Choose a provider: `Ollama (local)`, `Ollama Cloud`, `OpenAI`, `Claude`,
   `OpenRouter`, `Google Gemini`, or a `Custom OpenAI-compatible` endpoint.
2. The host, default model, and that provider's saved key fill in automatically.
   Cloud hosts are prefilled, so setup is usually just a key and a model.
3. Enter the API key (only cloud providers need one). It is stored securely on
   this device and kept per provider.
4. **Verify Connection** checks the endpoint and credentials.
5. **List Models** fetches the endpoint's models with a search filter;
   **Recommend Model** suggests a model tuned to your hardware or task.
6. **Test Chat** sends a tiny prompt and confirms the selected provider and model
   actually answer — quick quality confirmation before you rely on them.
7. **Forget this provider's key** clears just that one provider's key.
8. **On-device model...** opens the local model (GGUF) settings for llama.cpp.
9. Save (OK). The chosen provider/model becomes active immediately and Quill
   announces plain-language verification feedback (ready, auth failure, timeout,
   or endpoint unreachable).

Use `Prompt Studio` to save reusable templates and `Agent Center` to generate
guided task prompts. Ollama Cloud's free personal-use tier (with lower limits) is
available here too.

For release-safe beta validation, Word and CSV open in the normal plain-text
editor surface; AI connection and chat flows remain available.

#### Reading & Dictation

- **Read Aloud** submenu for start or pause, stop, and voice selection
- **Stop Reading** stops current read-aloud immediately
- **Say Selected** reads the current selection aloud
- **Read All** reads from the cursor to the end of the document
- **Dictation** submenu for Windows dictation, plus an opt-in **Hey QUILL Commands** toggle that lets dictation phrases trigger Quill commands instead of inserting text.
- **OCR Image...** converts an image to text via optical character recognition.

#### Watch Folder

- **Watch Folder Monitoring (in Settings)...** toggles automatic opening of supported files dropped into a configured folder.
- **Watch Folder Profiles...** configures folder path, subfolders, startup behavior, and polling behavior.
- **Watch Folder Queue...** shows current runtime state and active configuration.

When BITS Whisperer is enabled (QUILL 2.0), Watch Folder also appears in the BITS Whisperer submenu alongside Dictation.

Speech model selection intentionally follows a two-mode flow:

- **Recommended mode**: Quill selects a whisper model using machine-aware guidance (RAM/GPU profile).
- **Manual mode**: You pick a specific whisper model yourself.

In this phase, model infrastructure and download workflows are enabled while deeper runtime wiring remains staged.

Provider setup follows the same phased safety model:

- Use **Provider Center** for guided local-first or cloud-first setup choices.
- Use **Provider Status** to understand readiness and next steps.
- Providers are staged for rollout planning first; live provider routing remains gated in this phase.

Status Page behavior:

- **Help -> Status Page (HTML Preview)** now updates live while open.
- It surfaces asynchronous speech generation and BITS Whisperer download/provider status so users can monitor progress without blocking dialogs.
- In **Preferences -> General**, you can enable **Auto-open Status Page when BITS Whisperer model downloads start** (default off).
- In **Preferences -> General**, set **Status page refresh announcements** to **Quiet**, **Normal**, or **Verbose** to control screen-reader announcement cadence.
- In **Preferences -> General**, use **Use Artificial Intelligence** to mirror the Tools > AI Assistant toggle from one place.
- In **Preferences -> General**, enable **BITS Whisperer safe mode lock** to block download/retry actions while keeping status and onboarding surfaces available.

BITS Whisperer ships with safe defaults applied automatically; runtime routing changes stay off until you opt in from these Preferences surfaces.

Read Aloud is particularly useful for proofreading by ear. OCR Image handles image-to-text work with an explicit consent and progress flow.
Dictation uses Windows' own speech input. When Hey QUILL Commands is enabled, Quill stays silent and only listens while dictation is active, then runs the matching action after the wake phrase.
Watch Folder automation is best for "drop and open" workflows: copy supported files into one
folder and let Quill open them in the background.

BITS Whisperer phased rollout note:

- Quill is adopting BITS Whisperer speech capabilities in phases.
- Phase 1 focuses on machine-aware speech model management and safer setup guidance.
- Additional BITS Whisperer transcription runtime features, including expanded model execution paths,
  will be delivered incrementally in future phases.

#### GLOW

- **Audit Current Document**
- **Audit Selection**
- **Fix Current Document**
- **Fix Selection**

GLOW inside Quill is a guided layout and output workflow for deterministic text review. Today it focuses on plain text, Markdown, and HTML. It looks for issues such as:

- missing spaces after Markdown heading markers
- heading-level jumps
- generic link text
- missing HTML language metadata
- missing HTML image alt attributes
- tables without HTML header cells
- dense paragraphs and plain-language friction

The key design choice is how GLOW feels inside Quill. Audit results open as readable Quill tabs. Fixing the current document opens a named preview tab and immediately starts a compare session against the original. Selection fixes apply in place to the current selection, paragraph, or line. That keeps GLOW close to the writing experience instead of making it feel like a detached compliance tool.

#### Comparison

- **Compare with File...**
- **Compare Open Documents**
- **Next Difference** / **Previous Difference**
- **Announce Current Difference**
- **Difference List...**
- **Toggle Synchronized Navigation**
- **Compare Options...**
- **Create Difference Summary**
- **Copy Current Difference** / **Copy All Differences**

Quill's compare model is practical and local. It supports file-to-file review, multi-document review, summary generation, and synchronized movement through differences.

When a comparison is open you can move through it from the keyboard: **F8** for the next difference, **Shift+F8** for the previous one, **Ctrl+F8** to re-announce the current difference, and **Alt+F8** to hear the inline changed words. The compare dialog is a keyboard-first list you can review with a screen reader, one difference at a time.

If you use a sound pack, compare mode also plays short earcons: one when a comparison opens, one when it closes, distinct ticks for moving to the next or previous difference, and a soft "blocked" tone when you reach the first or last difference with nothing further to show. You can turn any of these on or off individually in **Tools → Reading & Dictation → Sound Events...** under the Compare section. See [Sound notifications and earcons](#sound-notifications-and-earcons).

#### Power Tools

Power Tools is the expanded home for automation utilities, developer tools, and editor-behavior power toggles.

**Editor utilities:**

- **Toggle Read-Only Guard** — prevents accidental edits to a document you are reviewing.
- **Toggle Clipboard Collector** / **Collect Clipboard Now** — accumulates clipboard entries into a running log.
- **Toggle Key Describer** — announces key names instead of performing actions; useful for documenting keystrokes.
- **Toggle Indentation Announcements** / **Infer Indentation...** — announces indentation level changes as you navigate.

**Macros:**

- **Start Recording** / **Stop Recording** — capture a sequence of editing commands.
- **Play Last Macro** — replay the last recorded sequence.
- **Manage Macros...** — name, edit, and organize saved macros.

Macros are ideal for repetitive cleanup: record once, replay as many times as needed.

**Authoring utilities:**

- **Regex Helper...** — full accessible dialog with recipe presets, plain-language pattern explanations, editable sample text, match previews with offsets, and one-step copy-to-Find-Replace.
- **Pandoc Conversion Wizard...** — converts supported source files into Markdown, HTML, or plain text that opens directly as a Quill tab.
- **External Tools and Format Support...** — explains what each supported helper unlocks, whether Quill can already see it, and the best first-touch setup path.
- **YAML Structure Editor...** — inspects and edits YAML front matter and structure files.

**Document Intake:**

- **Document Intake Report...** — answers how good an extraction was and whether the source likely contained structure that did not survive.
- **Review Extraction Quality...** — walks through extraction quality signals interactively.
- **Report Bad Extraction...** — escalates a source for manual cleanup or re-extraction.

These commands matter when Quill is acting as a trusted reader for imported formats. They help answer questions like: Is this document safe to quote from directly? Do I need to escalate for manual cleanup?

**Shell Integration:**

- **Install Shell Integration...** — registers Quill as a shell context-menu handler and protocol handler.
- **Remove Shell Integration** — unregisters shell extensions.

#### Accessibility

- **Accessibility Audit...**
- **Keyboard Trap & Tab-Order Snapshot...**
- **Validate Contrast...**
- **Link Inventory & Alt-Text Catalog...**
- **Speak Cursor Address**, **Speak Document Status**, and **Speak Selection Length** announce the caret position, document state, and selection size to your screen reader.

These tools help review the editor experience itself, the current document's link surface, and low-vision presentation issues.

#### Customize & Support

- **Preferences...**
- **Customize Menus...**
- **Profiles and Features...**
- **Status Bar Layout...**
- **Export and Back Up...** / **Import or Restore...**
- **Keymap Editor...** / **Export Keymap...** / **Import Keymap...** / **Reset Keymap**
- **Show Notifications**
- **Report a Bug...**
- **Save Diagnostics...**
- **Open Logs Folder** / **Open Diagnostics Folder**
- **Check for Updates**

Customize & Support merges the former separate Support and Customize submenus. All configuration and support paths live in one place, which is where both users and support staff expect to find them.

### Window

The **Window** menu is small but useful.

- **Next Document**
- **Previous Document**
- **Send to System Tray**

When you are juggling multiple notes, extracted files, and audit previews, these commands keep the workspace feeling controlled.

### Help

The **Help** menu is where Quill becomes a guide.

- **Open User Guide** opens this guide as an in-app document.
- **Open Welcome Guide** opens a lighter, profile-aware getting-started document.
- **Open Keyboard Reference** generates the current live shortcut reference from the active command registry.
- **Save Diagnostics...** writes a local diagnostics bundle you can review before sharing.
- **Report a Bug...** opens an in-app review screen, copies the environment summary to the clipboard, and then opens the Community Access support-hub issue form.
- **What Can I Do Here?** gives context-aware assistance.
- **Why Don't I See a Feature?** explains profile-driven feature visibility.
- **Feature Profiles** commands let you switch profile, run health checks, undo the last profile change, reset to Essential, and run onboarding.
- **Personalise QUILL...** (the first-run setup wizard) can be rerun at any time to adjust your keyboard pack, feature profile, remote access, AI, reading and accessibility, writing tools, and startup behaviour.
- **Check for Updates...** verifies the signed update manifest, opens the installer download page, and can close Quill so setup can run immediately.
- **About Quill** shows version, publisher details, and linked third-party dependency attribution with license and version metadata.
- **Open Third-Party Notices** opens a full notices document with dependency tables and bundled license texts.

If you only remember one thing about Help, remember this: it is a working surface, not a dead-end menu. The welcome guide teaches the basics, the keyboard reference reflects your live bindings, the user guide gives the full map, diagnostics package the current state, and the bug-report action turns that state into a support-ready starting point.

Menu stability note: Quill now defers internal menu-state updates while native menus are open, then applies them after menu close. This prevents rapid-arrow navigation churn and keeps Help menu navigation stable.

### How to report a problem from inside Quill

Use this path when Quill is behaving unexpectedly or when you want to send the team a feature request.

1. Open **Help -> Report a Bug...**. Focus lands on the Summary field, ready to type.
2. Optionally fill in your name and contact email. Quill remembers these and pre-fills them next time, so you only enter them once.
3. Pick your screen reader from the list (None, JAWS, NVDA, Narrator, VoiceOver, or Other). Quill pre-selects the one it detects. The choice is included in the report so the team can reproduce screen-reader-specific issues.
4. Read the in-app report summary Quill prepares for you.
5. Choose whether to include diagnostics, and whether to include plain file paths.
6. If diagnostics are included, save the diagnostics bundle to a location you can find again easily.
7. Choose **Open Support Form**.
8. When the Community Access support page opens, describe the problem, what you expected, and what actually happened.
9. Attach the diagnostics zip if it is relevant to the issue.

This unified flow keeps support reporting in one place. If you only need diagnostics, **Help -> Save Diagnostics...** remains available as a standalone export command.

## Writing and Editing

Quill's editing model is fast once you stop thinking of it as only a textbox.

### Everyday editing

Use the familiar commands first:

- `Ctrl+Z` to undo
- `Ctrl+Y` to redo
- `Ctrl+X`, `Ctrl+C`, `Ctrl+V` to move text
- `Ctrl+A` to select everything

Quill adds two especially useful ideas on top of that.

### Copy Tray

Copy Tray is **twelve** independently addressable clipboard slots that survive application restarts. Each slot holds text you copy there explicitly. Unlike the system clipboard — shared across every application and reset on every copy — Copy Tray slots belong exclusively to QUILL and hold their contents until you replace or clear them.

**Pasting from a slot is a single chord: hold `Ctrl+Shift` and press a number key.**

| Key | What happens |
| --- | --- |
| `Ctrl+Shift+1` through `Ctrl+Shift+9` | Paste from slots 1–9 |
| `Ctrl+Shift+0` | Paste from slot 10 |
| `Ctrl+Shift+-` | Paste from slot 11 |
| `Ctrl+Shift+=` | Paste from slot 12 |

**Copying to a slot uses the QUILL key prefix followed by the same key with Shift:**

| Key | What happens |
| --- | --- |
| `Ctrl+Shift+Grave, Shift+1` through `Shift+9` | Copy selection to slots 1–9 |
| `Ctrl+Shift+Grave, Shift+0` | Copy selection to slot 10 |
| `Ctrl+Shift+Grave, Shift+-` | Copy selection to slot 11 |
| `Ctrl+Shift+Grave, Shift+=` | Copy selection to slot 12 |

**Multi-press paste.** Press the paste chord multiple times quickly:

- **Single press** — paste the slot's content at the cursor (standard behaviour).
- **Double press** — peek: QUILL announces the slot's content without pasting it. Useful to check what a slot holds before committing to a paste.
- **Triple press** — open the Copy Tray dialog directly, focused on that slot.

**Copy to Next Empty Slot.** `Edit > Copy Tray > Copy to Next Empty Slot` copies the selection to the first unoccupied (and unpinned) slot in order 1–12 and announces which one: "Copied to slot 4 (first empty)." If all twelve slots are occupied, QUILL tells you rather than silently overwriting anything.

**Search Tray Slots.** `Edit > Copy Tray > Search Tray Slots...` opens a small search dialog. Type any word or phrase; QUILL searches all slot text and labels and announces matching slots. Press the corresponding digit key to paste that slot directly, or Escape to cancel.

**Pinned slots.** From the Copy Tray dialog, any slot can be marked Pinned. Pinned slots:

- Are never overwritten by "Copy to Next Empty Slot" routing.
- Are announced with a "pinned" prefix: "Slot 1 (pinned — signature)".
- Persist the pin flag in `copy_tray.json` across restarts.

To pin or unpin a slot, open the Copy Tray dialog (`Ctrl+Shift+Grave, X`), select the slot, and use the Pin/Unpin button.

**Paste submenu slot labels.** The `Edit > Copy Tray > Paste from Tray` submenu shows the label and a text preview for every occupied slot: "1  signature — Hi, I wanted to follow..." Screen readers hear both the label and the preview when navigating the submenu.

**Open the tray dialog:** `Ctrl+Shift+Grave, X` (or `Edit > Copy Tray > Open Copy Tray...`).

The dialog lists all twelve slots. Each row shows the slot number, an optional label, and a preview of the stored text. Navigate with arrow keys. Buttons:

- **Paste** — insert the selected slot's text at the cursor. Also activated by double-clicking or pressing Enter on a row.
- **Paste from Clipboard** — store the system clipboard into the selected slot.
- **Pin / Unpin** — toggle the pin state for the selected slot.
- **Save Changes** — save edits made directly in the content area.
- **Clear Slot** — empty the selected slot.
- **Close** — close without pasting.

**Status bar.** The `Slots: X/12` cell in the status bar shows how many of the twelve slots are occupied. Click the cell to open the Copy Tray dialog. Add the cell via `Tools > Customize & Support > Preferences > Status Bar` if it is not visible.

**Tray icon access.** The system tray icon menu also includes a Copy Tray submenu listing all occupied slots. Click any slot entry to paste its content into the active editor. This makes QUILL's clipboard available from the tray without bringing the window to the front.

**Tips.**

- Keep a signature, disclaimer, or standard heading in slot 1 and pin it. One chord pastes it anywhere and "Copy to Next Empty Slot" will never overwrite it.
- Use labelled slots for a research session: slot 1 "intro quote", slot 2 "methodology note", slot 3 "source URL". Copy one fragment per slot as you read, then paste in order when drafting.
- Double-press any paste chord to hear what is in that slot without pasting — useful when navigating your tray by memory.
- Slots survive restarts. Build a small library of recurring fragments you reach for daily.
- All bindings are reassignable in the Keymap Editor (`Tools > Customize & Support > Preferences > Keyboard`).

### Abbreviation Expansion

Abbreviation Expansion is a TextExpander-style feature. You type a short trigger word followed by any delimiter character (space, period, comma, and so on) and QUILL silently replaces the trigger with the full text.

**Example:** type `btw ` (note the trailing space) and QUILL replaces it with `by the way `.

QUILL ships with fifteen built-in abbreviations covering common shorthand. You can add, edit, and disable any abbreviation, including the built-in ones.

**Built-in abbreviations.**

| Abbreviation | Expansion |
| --- | --- |
| `afaik` | as far as I know |
| `afaict` | as far as I can tell |
| `asap` | as soon as possible |
| `atm` | at the moment |
| `btw` | by the way |
| `fwiw` | for what it's worth |
| `imo` | in my opinion |
| `imho` | in my humble opinion |
| `irl` | in real life |
| `omw` | on my way |
| `tbh` | to be honest |
| `tbc` | to be confirmed |
| `tbd` | to be determined |
| `ttyl` | talk to you later |
| `wrt` | with regard to |

**Enabling and disabling.** Abbreviation expansion is on by default. To toggle it:

- Press `Ctrl+Shift+Grave, E` — or use `Insert > Toggle Abbreviation Expansion`.
- Click the **ABR: On / ABR: Off** cell in the status bar (if visible; add it via status bar settings).
- Change **Abbreviation expansion** in `Tools > Customize & Support > Preferences > Editing`.

**Managing abbreviations.** Open `Insert > Manage Abbreviations...` (or press `Ctrl+Shift+Grave, Shift+A`) to add, edit, and organise your abbreviations. Each abbreviation has:

- **Abbreviation** — the short trigger word, e.g. `btw`.
- **Expansion** — the full text to substitute, e.g. `by the way`.
- **Description** — optional note for your own reference.
- **Case sensitive** — when checked, only the exact-case trigger matches; otherwise any capitalisation of the trigger fires.
- **Enabled** — toggle individual abbreviations without deleting them.

The manager dialog includes a **Search** field at the top. Type any part of a trigger word or expansion text to filter the list in real time. Disabled abbreviations appear with a "(disabled)" suffix.

The manager also has **Import** and **Export** buttons for JSON round-trips. Export saves your full library to a file. Import merges a file into your library; abbreviations with duplicate IDs are skipped. QUILL announces how many were added on import.

**Manual trigger.** Press `Ctrl+Shift+Grave, A` (or `Insert > Expand Abbreviation`) to expand the word immediately before the cursor without typing a delimiter character. Useful when you want expansion mid-word or at end-of-document.

**Variables in expansions.** Expansions support these placeholders:

| Placeholder | Inserts |
| --- | --- |
| `${cursor}` | Places the cursor here after expansion |
| `${date}` | Current date (e.g. June 11, 2026) |
| `${time}` | Current time (e.g. 02:30 PM) |
| `${clipboard}` | Current system clipboard text |

**Multi-press window.** The double/triple press detection window is configurable in `Tools > Customize & Support > Preferences > Editing` as **Multi-press window (ms)** (default 400 ms; range 100–1000 ms). A larger window helps if you press keys slowly; a smaller window prevents accidental double-fires for fast typists.

**Sound feedback.** Optional: enable **Play sound on abbreviation expansion** in `Tools > Customize & Support > Preferences > Editing` and optionally point **Abbreviation expansion sound file** to a `.wav` file. Leave the path blank for the default system beep.

**Tips.**

- Use `${cursor}` to drop the cursor inside a template. For example, the abbreviation `sig` expanding to `Best regards,${cursor}Jeff` positions the cursor right after the comma.
- Use case-sensitive abbreviations sparingly — most triggers are lowercase and case sensitivity is rarely needed.
- Abbreviations fire before snippet expansion. If a word matches both, the abbreviation wins.
- Export your library regularly as a backup and to share abbreviations between machines.

### Copy With Source

`Ctrl+Shift+C` copies the current selection, then appends a source reference that captures document context. If nothing is selected, Quill uses the current line. This is excellent for notes, review workflows, and evidence gathering.

### Selection bindings

**F8-based anchor selection**

Quill uses an anchor-based selection model:

| Key | Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| F8 | Start selection | Sets an invisible anchor at the cursor. |
| Shift+F8 | Complete selection | Selects from anchor to cursor and announces the span. |
| Ctrl+Shift+F8 | Reselect | Restores the most recent committed selection. |
| Alt+Shift+F8 | Go to start of selection | Moves the cursor to the selection start without changing it. |
| Ctrl+F8 | Copy all | Copies the full document. |
| Ctrl+Shift+A | Unselect all | Collapses the selection to the cursor. |
| Alt+F8 | Read all | Reads the document from the beginning. |

**Structural selection**

| Key | Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| (unassigned by default) | Select paragraph | Selects the paragraph at the cursor; announces scope and word count. Assign a key in the Keyboard Manager or run it from the command palette. |
| Ctrl+Shift+B | Select block | Selects the indented block at the cursor. |
| Alt+Shift+Up | Expand selection | Grows the selection to the next structural unit (line to paragraph to block to document). |
| Alt+Shift+Down | Shrink selection | Reverses the last expand step. |

**Extend Selection Mode**

Extend Selection Mode makes movement commands extend the selection rather than move the cursor. Toggle it from the Selection menu (no default key; assign one in Preferences > Keyboard). When active, an **EXT** badge appears in the status bar.

**Mark ring**

The mark ring is a rolling stack of temporary jump points for in-session back-and-forth navigation:

| Key | Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ctrl+Shift+M | Set mark | Places a temporary mark at the cursor. |
| Ctrl+M | Pop mark | Jumps to the most recent mark and removes it from the ring. |
| Ctrl+Shift+X | Exchange point and mark | Swaps the cursor and the top mark position. |
| Alt+M | List marks | Shows all marks with line and column positions. |

**Named marks and review buffer**

Named marks are persistent within a session. Reach them via **Selection > Named Marks**:

- **Set Named Mark**: names and stores the current cursor position; announces line and column.
- **Jump to Named Mark**: choose from a list showing each mark's name and position; jumps on selection.
- **Open Review Buffer**: opens the active selection in a read-only dialog for non-destructive screen-reader paging. Requires a selection.

None of these have default key bindings. Assign them in Preferences > Keyboard, or use the Selection menu.

### Links

`Ctrl+K` inserts a format-aware link. `Ctrl+Enter` follows the link under the caret. In Markdown and HTML, this makes citation and cross-referencing much less tedious.

## Search, Replace, and Deep Navigation

Quill's search tools are both straightforward and layered.

### Standard search

- `Ctrl+F` opens search.
- `F3` finds next.
- `Shift+F3` finds previous.
- `Alt+F3` opens a find-all matches summary.
- `Ctrl+Shift+H` opens Replace.

### Search modes

Quill supports plain text, whole-word, wildcard, and regular-expression search. The Regex Helper explains the syntax when you need it. Search history is also preserved, so recurring search jobs get easier over time.

### Navigation that understands documents

Quill is excellent for large documents because it supports:

- line and page jumps
- block and heading movement
- bracket matching
- structural next and previous
- back and forward location history
- outline navigation
- bookmarks

When you combine this with marks and compare sessions, long-form review starts to feel much less fragile.

### Code-aware editing

When you open a source file, Quill loads a **language profile** based on the file extension — Python, JavaScript and TypeScript, Kotlin, Shell, Markdown, JSON, TOML, and SQL are recognised, with a plain-text fallback for everything else. The profile tells Quill how that language is tokenised so movement and announcements make sense for code.

- **Token navigation.** Move by code token rather than by word with **Next Token** and **Previous Token** in the Navigate menu. The caret lands on the next identifier, keyword, operator, or literal, which is far more predictable than character or word movement when you are reading code by ear.
- **Set the language yourself.** Auto-detection follows the file extension, but you can override it for the current document with **Navigate → Set Document Language** — useful for an unsaved buffer, an unusual extension, or a snippet pasted into a plain file.
- **Pairs with indentation tones.** Code-aware editing works well alongside the optional indentation tones described under [Sound notifications and earcons](#sound-notifications-and-earcons), so structure is carried by pitch while you move by token.

## QUILL Quick Nav Mode

QUILL Quick Nav mode is a browse-style, cursor-only navigation layer for long documents. It is movement-only: it changes cursor location, never edits text.

There are two ways to enter Quick Nav mode:

- **Locked Quick Nav (the common path).** Press `Ctrl+Shift+Grave` twice in a row. The first press arms the QUILL-key prefix; the second press (QK-5) locks browse mode on, ignores the prefix timeout, and stays active until you press `Esc`. QUILL announces "QUILL browse mode locked. It stays active until you press Escape."
- **One-shot Quick Nav chord.** Press `Ctrl+Shift+Grave, N`. QUILL enters Quick Nav mode for the next move; if the `browse_mode_sticky` setting is on (SET-4), it stays locked until `Esc`; otherwise the mode expires when the QUILL-key timeout elapses.

Either way, once Quick Nav is active the mnemonic single-key bindings below work the same. The chord table at the top of the user guide and the cheat sheet (`Ctrl+Shift+Grave, ?`) are the live reference.

While the mode is active:

- `H` moves to the next heading.
- `Shift+H` moves to the previous heading.
- `1` through `6` move to the next heading at that specific level.
- `Shift+1` through `Shift+6` move to the previous heading at that specific level.
- `A` and `Shift+A` move by link anchor.
- `L` and `Shift+L` move by list container.
- `I` and `Shift+I` move by list item.
- `T` and `Shift+T` move by table.
- `Q` and `Shift+Q` move by block quote.
- `B` and `Shift+B` move by bookmark.
- `'` and `Shift+'` move by code block.
- `C` opens table of contents (Outline Navigator).
- `P` and `Shift+P` move by paragraph.
- `S` and `Shift+S` move by sentence.
- `Tab` and `Shift+Tab` move by block.
- `.` (period) repeats the last browse action.
- `]` jumps to the next line after the current list or table.
- `[` jumps to the line above the current list or table.
- `Esc` exits QUILL Quick Nav mode.

Behavior rules:

- This mode does not edit text.
- It only changes cursor location.
- If a target does not exist for the active surface, Quill announces that clearly.
- Find and replace commands return you to normal command flow automatically.
- In `Preferences -> General`, **Preload QUILL browse cache in background** is on by default. If you turn it off, Quill builds the cache the first time you use Quick Nav.

How Quill tracks headings, lists, list items, paragraphs, and sentences:

- Quill creates a navigation index for the active document and reuses it until content or surface type changes.
- The index key is document text plus markup type, so unchanged documents do not pay repeated parse cost.
- Headings are parsed from Markdown and HTML heading structure.
- List-item anchors come from Markdown list markers and HTML `<li>` tags.
- Paragraph anchors come from blank-line boundaries in text/Markdown and block-level tags in HTML.
- Sentence anchors come from sentence-ending punctuation patterns.
- Table anchors come from Markdown table starts and HTML `<table>` tags.
- Block-quote anchors come from Markdown `>` quote starts and HTML `<blockquote>` tags.
- Code-block anchors come from Markdown fenced code boundaries and HTML `<pre>` or `<code>` tags.
- Bookmark anchors come from your in-memory bookmark positions.
- The index is invalidated after edits, full document replacement operations, and tab/document switches.

Performance note:

- Quick Nav avoids reparsing on every key press by caching artifact anchors.
- This keeps movement responsive on long Markdown and HTML files.

### QUILL key prefix actions

Pressing the QUILL key (`Ctrl+Shift+Grave`) once arms a short prefix. Follow it with:

- `N` to enter browse/Quick Nav mode. If the `browse_mode_sticky` setting is on, the mode stays locked until `Esc`; otherwise it expires on the QUILL-key timeout. (Press the QUILL key alone a second time to lock browse mode on regardless of the setting.)
- `G` to open Go to Anything (Quick Nav search).
- `M` to **paste HTML clipboard content as Markdown** at the cursor. Quill reads the
  clipboard's rich HTML (the `HTML Format` flavour copied from web pages and word
  processors), converts headings, lists, links, bold/italic, code, and block quotes to
  Markdown, and inserts the result. If no rich HTML is present, the plain-text clipboard
  is treated as HTML. The active read-only guard is respected, so a read-only document is
  never modified.
- `A` for selection actions when text is selected.
- `F` to **speak the window title**, `P` to **speak the full file path** of the current document, and `Q` to **speak a short status summary**. These let you confirm where you are without leaving the editor, which is handy when several documents are open.
- `?` to show the QUILL key cheat sheet, or `Esc` to cancel the prefix.

## Formatting and Markup Work

Quill understands that many users work in plain text while still caring deeply about exported structure.

### Markdown and HTML awareness

Quill detects whether the current surface looks like Markdown, HTML, or plain text. It uses that to guide insertion helpers and enable the commands that make sense in context.

### Headings and lists

The heading tools do more than insert decoration. They help you maintain usable structure. The list tools speed up common authoring patterns without forcing you into a separate composer.

### Citations and bibliographies

For research writing, **Insert -> Insert Citation...** builds correctly formatted citations from details you type, so you do not have to wrestle with the punctuation and indentation rules by hand.

1. Choose the **source type**: Book, Journal article, or Website.
2. Choose the **style**: MLA 9, Chicago 17 (author-date), or APA 7.
3. Choose what to **insert**: the in-text citation, the full bibliography (Works Cited / References) entry, or both.
4. Fill in the source details — author(s), title, year, and the fields relevant to the source type. Separate multiple authors with a semicolon (for example `Jane Smith; John Doe`).
5. Choose **Insert**, and Quill places the correctly formatted citation at your cursor.

Quill applies the per-style rules for you — author order and "et al.", initials, italics, and where each comma and period belongs — so what lands in your document is ready to use. You supply the facts; Quill handles the formatting.

Markdown list editing now follows editor-standard behavior: `Enter` continues the current bullet/numbered/task item, and `Enter` on an empty list marker exits the list. When the caret is on a list item, `Tab` nests it and `Shift+Tab` promotes it. For larger reorganizations, use **Format -> List -> List Manager...** (`Ctrl+Shift+Grave, L`) to move, promote/demote, add, edit, and delete list items from a tree view.

For heading presentation control, open **Insert -> Heading -> Style Headings...**. You can style either all heading levels or the current heading level, then set font family, point size, and alignment. In Markdown documents, styled headings are written as HTML heading tags so the formatting is preserved.

For structure editing, open **Navigate -> Heading Organizer...** (`Ctrl+Shift+Grave, O`). The organizer lists each heading as level + title, supports keyboard promotion/demotion (`Tab` and `Shift+Tab`), lets you move sections up/down, rename headings, and validates heading order (start level, skipped levels, empty headings) before apply.

### Tables, code blocks, and tags

Quill includes guided insertion for tables, code blocks, HTML tags, and Markdown snippets. This is especially useful for users who want structure but do not want to hand-type every opening and closing marker correctly every time.

### Cleanup and normalization

The cleanup commands under **Tools → Convert** are ideal for pasted material, transcripts, exports, and migration work. Use them when you need to turn messy text into something more stable and readable.

### Character encoding tools

Under **Format → HTML & Encoding**, Quill includes three tools for the encoding friction that comes up when preparing text for the web, where one tool wants UTF-8 and the next insists on plain ASCII:

- **Show Non-ASCII Characters** opens a read-only report listing every character above plain ASCII, with its line and column, codepoint, Unicode name, and whether it converts cleanly to Latin-1 and to Windows-1252 (MS-ANSI). Reviewing that report with a screen reader replaces the old command-line trick of running a file through `iconv` with a sentinel string and hunting for what failed to convert.
- **Convert Non-ASCII to HTML Entities** rewrites every non-ASCII character as its HTML entity — a named entity such as `&eacute;` where one exists, or a numeric `&#233;` otherwise — while leaving ordinary ASCII (including `&` and `<`) untouched. This is the reliable way to feed text to a tool, such as Pandoc, that refuses to handle high characters. Note that the older **Encode HTML Entities** command only escapes the five markup characters (`<`, `>`, `&`, `"`, `'`); this new command is the one that handles accents and symbols.
- **Re-encode As...** saves a copy of the document in a chosen encoding — UTF-8, UTF-8 with a byte-order mark, Latin-1, Windows-1252, or ASCII. Anything that does not fit a narrow target is written as a numeric HTML entity rather than a silent question mark, so the conversion is lossless and recoverable.

## Tools for Reading, Review, and Inspection

Quill earns trust by making difficult files readable and inspectable.

### Read Aloud

Read Aloud uses local voices with a deterministic support policy. DECtalk and eSpeak NG are bundled for immediate local playback. Piper and Kokoro are available as explicit downloads from Speech Center so base installs stay smaller. You can start, pause, stop, preview, and choose a voice. Speech onboarding announces current availability and recommended next actions before any download starts.

### EPUB Navigator

When you open an EPUB, the navigator gives you chapter-aware movement rather than forcing you to scroll blindly through one long extraction.

### OCR Image

OCR is explicit and local. You choose the image, confirm the action, and receive progress updates. This keeps OCR useful without making it invisible or surprising.

### Document intake and extraction quality

These commands are where Quill feels especially mature for accessibility-minded reading work. Rather than assuming every import is trustworthy, Quill gives you tools to ask whether the extraction is good enough, what may have been lost, and whether you should quote from the result directly.

## GLOW Workflows Inside Quill

Glow in Quill is about guided confidence. It is not trying to turn the editor into a giant compliance dashboard. It is trying to make accessibility-aware review and safe deterministic fixes feel ordinary.

### Audit flows

Use document audit when you want the whole file reviewed. Use selection audit when you only care about the paragraph, block, or snippet in front of you.

Audit results open as normal Quill tabs. You can read them, search them, compare them, or keep them open alongside the source.

### Fix flows

Use selection fix for quick cleanup in place. Use document fix when you want Quill to generate a preview and immediately compare original versus fixed output.

This is where the native integration matters most. GLOW does not pull you away from your working context. It creates another working context beside it.

### What GLOW is best at today

The first native slice is strongest with:

- plain text review
- Markdown cleanup
- HTML accessibility-aware cleanup
- link-text review
- heading spacing and heading-level sanity
- lightweight readability guidance

The 1.0 roadmap expands this into findings navigation, export-readiness workflows, and richer extraction-aware review for PDF and EPUB.

## Accessibility and Low-Vision Features

Quill is designed so accessibility is visible, not hidden.

### Region model

Use `F6` and `Shift+F6` to move between editor and other major regions. Quill announces those region transitions consistently.

### Keyboard trap and accessibility audit

The keyboard trap snapshot and accessibility audit commands are there to help verify the interface itself. This is useful both for users and for testers helping improve the product.

### Contrast and theme behavior

You can validate contrast, switch dark mode, and align with system behavior. This matters for users who need a predictable low-vision experience rather than a single visual theme.

### Status bar as an accessible control surface

Quill's status bar is navigable and interactive. This is a subtle but important design decision. It keeps useful information close while still making it reachable from the keyboard.

### Sound notifications and earcons

Quill can play short, non-speech audio cues — earcons — at meaningful editing moments, so your screen reader stays free for the text while sound carries the "something happened" signal. This is entirely optional and off by default for most events; speech is never replaced.

- **Sound packs (QSP).** A sound pack is a directory (or a `.qsp` zip) of WAV files with a `manifest.json` mapping event IDs to sounds. Quill ships the **Ink** pack of synthesised earcons. Choose a pack in **Preferences → Sound**, and set the volume there too.
- **Per-event control.** Open **Tools → Reading & Dictation → Sound Events...** to turn individual events on or off. Events are grouped — Earcons, Compare, and (when an indent-tone pack is loaded) Indentation tones — so you can keep, say, save and search cues while silencing others.
- **Indentation tones.** For code and other indented text, Quill can play a pitched tone as the caret crosses indent levels: the tone rises as you go deeper and falls as you come back out. Pick a musical scale (pentatonic, whole-tone, diatonic, or chromatic) under the **Indentation tones** setting, or leave it Off. Blank lines stay silent and hold the previous level.
- **Compare cues.** When a sound pack is active, compare mode plays distinct cues for opening and closing a comparison, moving to the next or previous difference, and bumping against the first or last difference. See [Comparison](#comparison).
- **Toggle everything.** **Toggle Sound Notifications** (in Reading & Dictation) turns all earcons on or off at once, and plays a short confirming "on" or "off" cue so you know which state you landed in.

Every scripted earcon in the bundled pack is a distinct sound, so two different events never sound identical. Pack authors can map any event ID to any WAV file; the full QSP format and event reference are documented in the product requirements document, under "Sound notifications and QSP sound packs."

## Quill on macOS

Quill runs on **macOS** as well as Windows, from one codebase, with feature parity as the goal.

- **VoiceOver-first.** On macOS, Quill routes its announcements to **VoiceOver** and never speaks over it. Headings, regions, and result messages behave the way they do on Windows with NVDA/JAWS.
- **On-device AI.** Ask Quill uses **Apple Foundation Models** (Apple Intelligence) on a supported Mac — no model download and no cloud. The on-device GGUF/llama.cpp picker is hidden on macOS because Apple's model is used instead; you can still connect Ollama or a cloud endpoint if you prefer.
- **Standard Mac behaviors.** Preferences and About use the standard macOS menu locations (`Quill -> Settings`, `Quill -> About Quill`).
- **Signed and notarized.** Release Mac builds are code-signed with a Developer ID certificate and notarized by Apple, so Gatekeeper opens them without warnings. The app ships as a `.app` (and disk image).
- **The accessible WebView** that powers the chat, the Markdown/HTML preview, the About box, and the update dialogs reads correctly under VoiceOver, just as it does under NVDA and JAWS on Windows.

## Profiles, Keyboard Packs, and Customization

Quill is customizable, but it tries to keep customization coherent.

### Feature profiles

Profiles shape which feature clusters are on, quiet, or off. This helps Quill stay calm for new users without stripping power from advanced users.

Use **Profiles and Features...** to:

- switch profiles
- quick-switch profiles from anywhere with `Alt+Shift+P`
- compare profiles
- undo the last profile change
- reset to Essential
- import and export profile data
- create custom profiles
- update a custom profile from your current feature/settings/keymap state
- delete custom profiles

Custom profiles support an explicit inheritance choice:

- **Inherit parent profile** keeps the selected built-in profile as the starting point.
- **Bare-bones start** opts out of inherited features and starts with only locked core safety features enabled.

### Keyboard packs

Quill now supports golden keyboard packs so the editor can feel familiar from day one. Available packs include:

- Quill Default
- Quill Writer
- Quill Navigation
- Quill Review
- Windows Notepad
- Notepad++
- VS Code
- Microsoft Word

Choose a pack in **Profiles and Features...**. If you later hand-edit shortcuts or import a custom keymap, Quill automatically switches the pack label to **Custom**.

### Keymap editor

Use the keymap editor when you want to rebind a single command. Quill detects conflicts and warns you before reassigning a binding already in use.

### Keyboard manager for QUILL Quick Nav

QUILL Quick Nav actions appear in Keymap Editor as dedicated entries:

- `QUILL Quick Nav: Link`
- `QUILL Quick Nav: List`
- `QUILL Quick Nav: List Item`
- `QUILL Quick Nav: Table`
- `QUILL Quick Nav: Block Quote`
- `QUILL Quick Nav: Bookmark`
- `QUILL Quick Nav: Code Block`
- `QUILL Quick Nav: Table of Contents`
- `QUILL Quick Nav: Paragraph`
- `QUILL Quick Nav: Sentence`
- `QUILL Quick Nav: Heading`
- `QUILL Quick Nav: Block`

Exact rebinding examples:

1. Open `Tools -> Customize & Support -> Keymap Editor...`.
2. Choose `QUILL Quick Nav: Link`.
3. Enter `K` if you want link jumps on `K` instead of `A`.
4. Choose `QUILL Quick Nav: Code Block`.
5. Enter `\`` (grave) if you prefer grave instead of apostrophe.

Notes:

- Conflicts are blocked by the keymap editor before saving.
- Quick Nav keys are interpreted only while QUILL Quick Nav mode is active.

### Status bar settings

If the current status bar is too busy or not informative enough, change it. You can reorder items and choose which ones stay visible.

### Settings you can change today

Quill's current settings and customization surface covers the things you are most likely to want to tune every day.

- theme behavior, including dark mode
- soft wrap
- recent files limit
- system tray mode
- persistent undo
- spell check as you type
- line-number visibility
- whether Quill starts with no document open
- read-aloud voice selection
- active feature profile
- active keyboard pack
- custom keybindings through the keymap editor
- status-bar order and status-bar visibility

Some of these live in the View menu for quick toggling; the preference-style toggles now live in the **Settings** dialog (**Tools -> Customize & Support -> Preferences...**). Others live in **Profiles and Features...**, **Status Bar Layout...**, **Keymap Editor...**, and the related customization commands under **Tools -> Customize & Support**.

## Trust, Recovery, Sessions, and Safety

Quill is serious about recovery and user control.

### Notebooks

A **Notebook** is a named collection of documents that belong together — a novel's chapters, a research project's notes, a software project's specs. Notebooks live in a single `.quillnotebook` file and keep track of which files are entries, where you left each caret, any goals you have set, and saved snapshots of which entries were open.

**Creating a Notebook.** Use **File > Notebook > New Notebook** to create an empty notebook and give it a name. Use **File > Notebook > New from Folder** to import an entire folder at once — Quill walks the folder recursively and creates one entry per supported file. You can filter by extension (the default set covers Markdown, plain text, HTML, and source code).

**Opening and navigating entries.** Once a Notebook is open, **Navigate > Go to Entry in Notebook** opens the tree navigator, which groups entries by subdirectory. Select an entry and press Enter (or click "Open Entry") to open that file. For headings, **Navigate > Go to Heading in Notebook** scans every entry file and presents a two-level tree.

**Entries panel.** Toggle **View > Show Entries Panel** to slide a docked panel into the left side of the window. The panel shows the notebook name, today's goal progress, a live filter field, and the full entries list. Type in the filter field to narrow by title.

**Goals.** Each Notebook can carry a daily word-count goal stored in its `.quillnotebook` file. When the goal is enabled, the **Notebook Goal** status-bar cell shows progress (for example, "1,234 / 500 words"). Reaching the target changes the label to "Goal reached."

**Snapshots.** A Snapshot is a named point-in-time record of which entries were open. Use **File > Notebook > Save Snapshot** to save one, and **File > Notebook > Manage Snapshots** to rename or delete saved snapshots. Snapshots are different from autosave recovery — they are explicit saves you make yourself, like commit checkpoints for your writing session.

**Snapshots vs Sessions.** The **File > Snapshots** menu (formerly "Workspace Snapshots") saves and restores the set of open documents in the editor — a lightweight workspace for any files, not tied to a Notebook. Notebook Snapshots store the open-entry state within a single Notebook.

### Sessions

Sessions in Quill are best understood as **workspace snapshots**. A session captures your currently open documents and active tab, then lets you reopen that exact working set later.

If you are familiar with VS Code workspaces, think of Quill sessions as a simpler, document-focused version of that idea:

- save your current workspace state
- reopen it from Recent Snapshots
- quickly switch among open documents in the current workspace group

This is useful when one writing task spans notes, references, drafts, and generated reports.

### Marks vs bookmarks (and the ring)

Quill has two jump systems on purpose:

- **Bookmarks** are named jump points. They are explicit, easy to list, and best for durable places you want to revisit by name.
- **Marks** are temporary jump points in a **ring**. The ring is a rolling stack of recent mark locations for fast back-and-forth movement while editing.

Use bookmarks for long-lived anchors; use marks when you are actively traversing and reshaping text.

### Autosave and backups

Quill autosaves at a timed interval and keeps backup snapshots. It avoids unnecessary duplicate autosave writes and keeps state management efficient.

### Recovery

If Quill closes unexpectedly, it can offer a recovery snapshot on the next launch. That is not a dramatic feature. It is a humane one.

### Persistent undo

When enabled, persistent undo stores undo history for saved files across sessions. Quill now throttles those writes so the feature stays practical on large documents.

### Trusted locations

Trusted locations reduce repeated prompts when you regularly work from the same folders. This is especially useful in document-review and institutional workflows.

### Safe mode

Safe mode opens Quill with optional state turned off. If you are troubleshooting a bad session or strange startup behavior, safe mode is a good first step.

### Notifications and updates

Quill keeps an internal notification center for update and workflow events. Update checks verify a signed manifest before offering a download.

## Working with Different Document Types

Quill is strongest today with plain text, Markdown, HTML, RTF, EPUB, and extracted text workflows. It also has intake and extraction review features for imported material such as PDF/OCR sources and structured import support for Office-style formats.

### Plain text

Plain text stays plain. Quill does not force hidden formatting into it.

### Markdown

Markdown gets structure-aware commands, list helpers, heading helpers, links, code blocks, and GLOW review.

### HTML

HTML gets tag insertion, structure-aware editing help, link handling, and GLOW review focused on language metadata, image alt text, heading order, and table headers.

### RTF

RTF documents can use Quill's optional **Rich text lens**, a screen-reader-first rich editing surface. It is **off by default**: the standard plain-text editor stays Quill's writing path unless you opt in under Settings, Editing (the "Editor surface" choice). Turn it on and `.rtf` files open in the Rich text lens, which renders bold, italic, headings, bullets, and links natively. Your document text stays Quill Markdown underneath, so search, outline, metrics, autosave, and persistent undo keep working exactly as in plain-text mode. Press the editing-lens shortcut (`Ctrl+Shift+` ` then `K`) to switch losslessly between the rich view and the Markdown lens; no words are lost and the document is not marked changed by switching. When an RTF file contains unsafe embedded content (such as OLE objects) Quill strips it on open and tells you; remote fields are flagged for your consent rather than fetched silently.

### CSV and TSV

CSV and TSV files open through a choice flow: special CSV grid mode or normal text editor mode. You can remember your preferred default and still switch modes from inside the tab at any time. Grid mode is keyboard-friendly and designed for screen-reader users who need cell-level table editing without leaving Quill.

### Word (.docx and .doc)

Word documents open through a choice flow: structured Word view or normal text editor mode. You can remember your preferred default and still switch modes inside the tab.

Structured Word view is optimized for accessibility: it prioritizes readable structure and linearized table narration (headers and rows) for screen readers. Normal text mode keeps full Quill editing behavior for direct edits.

**Saving to Word.** You can also save any document *as* Word. In **File -> Save As...**, choose **Word Document (*.docx)** (or **Rich Text Format (*.rtf)**) from the file-type list, and Quill converts the current content to that format on save. Markdown and HTML structure — headings, lists, emphasis, links, simple tables — maps to real Word styles, so the result is navigable in Word, not just visually formatted. Saving plain text produces a correct but unformatted document, since plain text has no structure to carry.

### EPUB

EPUB gets navigator support and chapter-oriented reading.

### PowerPoint (.pptx and .ppt)

PowerPoint imports are structure-aware: slide titles become headings, slide bullets become nested list items, tables are rendered into tab-friendly text tables, and speaker notes are included when present.

### Excel-style spreadsheets (.xlsx and .xls)

Spreadsheet intake is text-first and structure-aware. Quill extracts sheets into readable table-oriented text so you can inspect and review content quickly. If optional converters are installed, extraction quality improves for legacy and mixed-format files.

### PDF and OCR-derived text

PDF and OCR work are where Quill's extraction review commands matter most. Treat those commands as quality checks, not optional extras.

### Remote files (FTP, SFTP, HTTPS, WebDAV, S3)

Quill can open, save, and copy to remote hosts the same way it works with local files. Remote I/O is explicit, audible, and reversible:

- **Open from Remote...** lists every site you have saved, lets you browse a remote directory, and downloads a file you choose. The download is announced with the host and expected size, lands in a temp file, and opens in a normal tab titled with a `(from site:path)` suffix. The document is **read-only** until you save it back through **Save Copy to Remote...** or copy it to local storage.
- **Save to Remote** writes the active document to a remote path you choose, on a site you have configured, with a tilde-backup next to the original. **Save Copy to Remote...** lets you keep the local file and write a copy without changing the source.
- **Manage Remote Sites...** adds, edits, and deletes saved sites for the five supported protocols. Each site's password is stored in **Windows Credential Manager** when available, then in a DPAPI-protected JSON file, with a macOS Keychain facade for cross-platform parity.
- All remote traffic uses a **verified TLS context**. Cloud endpoints (S3, HTTPS, WebDAV over HTTPS) must be HTTPS; FTP is allowed because the user opted in for LAN or legacy hosts.
- All remote operations are wired to the **network egress audit** (`quill/tools/network_egress_audit.py`) with explicit rationales, and S3 and WebDAV XML responses are parsed through `quill.core.safe_xml.fromstring` so an attacker cannot reach an external-entity expansion through a crafted listing.

Default keys: **QUILL key, then `Shift+O`** opens from remote; **QUILL key, then `W`** saves to remote; **QUILL key, then `Shift+M`** opens the site manager. All are remappable from Preferences > Keyboard.

### GitHub Remote Files

QUILL can browse GitHub repositories, open files from them, and save changes back to GitHub — all without installing Git, the GitHub CLI, or GitHub Desktop.

**Getting started**

The first time you open a GitHub feature, QUILL asks you to confirm that it may connect to GitHub. This is a one-time prompt. After that, QUILL remembers your choice.

You do not need a GitHub account to browse public repositories. For private repositories, you need a Personal Access Token (PAT).

**Creating a Personal Access Token**

1. Go to github.com and sign in.
2. Open Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens > Tokens (classic).
3. Click Generate new token.
4. Give it a name such as "QUILL" and select the `repo` scope (or `public_repo` if you only need public repositories).
5. Copy the token. You will only see it once.

QUILL stores your token securely in **Windows Credential Manager**. It is never saved in a text file.

**Opening the repository browser**

Open **File > Open from Remote > GitHub Repository...**

The browser has these parts:

- **Account** — shows your GitHub username, or "Anonymous" if no token is stored.
- **Repository** — type an owner/repo name such as `microsoft/vscode` and press Enter or click Load.
- **Branch or tag** — choose which version of the repository to browse. Defaults to the repository's default branch.
- **Current path** — shows where you are in the folder tree.
- **File list** — lists folders and files. Folders appear first.
- **Status** — shows progress messages and item counts.

Navigation:
- Press Enter on a folder to open it.
- Press Enter on a file to open it (same as clicking Open File).
- Press Backspace to go up one level.
- Press F5 to refresh the current folder.
- Tab through the buttons: **Open File**, **Go Up**, **Refresh**, **Copy URL**, **Cancel**.

**Opening a file by URL**

If you have a GitHub file URL (for example from a colleague), use **File > Open from Remote > GitHub File URL...**

Paste a URL in the form `https://github.com/owner/repo/blob/branch/path/to/file` and press Enter. QUILL fetches the file directly.

**Saving back to GitHub**

After you have opened a file from GitHub and made edits, use **File > Open from Remote > Save to GitHub...**

QUILL will ask for a commit message. Type a short description of your changes and press Enter. QUILL commits your changes to the same repository, branch, and file path using the GitHub API.

Notes:
- You need a token with write permission (`repo` scope) to save back.
- If the file was changed on GitHub since you opened it, QUILL will tell you to refresh and try again.
- This command does not run automatically when you press Save. You must choose it deliberately.

**Managing your GitHub account**

Use **File > Open from Remote > Manage GitHub Accounts...** to:

- See your current GitHub identity.
- Add or replace a token.
- Sign out and clear your stored token.

**File size limit**

GitHub's file API is limited to 1 MB. Files larger than that must be downloaded manually from github.com.

**Enabling the feature**

GitHub remote access is controlled by the feature flag `core.github_remote`. If it is not visible, open **File > Open from Remote** and check whether the GitHub items appear. If PyGithub is not installed, QUILL shows a message explaining how to install it: `pip install "quill[github]"`.

## Help, Learning, and Daily Confidence

Quill includes several layers of help because confidence does not come from memorizing everything.

- **F1** — context-sensitive help for the focused control. Works anywhere in the application.
- **Ctrl+F1** — opens this User Guide.
- **Shift+F1** — opens the document-context "What Can I Do Here?" panel.
- **Open Welcome Guide** when you want a lighter orientation.
- **Open User Guide** when you want the full map.
- **Open Keyboard Reference** when you want exact current bindings.
- **What Can I Do Here?** when you need immediate, contextual guidance.
- **Why Don't I See a Feature?** when a command seems to have disappeared.

That last command matters more than it first appears. It turns feature visibility from a mystery into an explanation.

### Context-Sensitive Help (F1)

Press `F1` on any focusable control in QUILL and a small dialog opens that describes:

1. **The dialog you are in** (when you are inside a dialog box) — the dialog name and a plain-language summary of what it does, so you always know your context.
2. **The focused control** — what the control is, how it works, and what keyboard shortcuts apply to it.

The entire text is in one read-only field so your screen reader announces everything in a single pass when the dialog opens, without you having to navigate past heading elements.

From the help dialog you can:

- Press **Escape** or **Enter on Close** to dismiss and return to where you were.
- Press **Tab to Open User Guide** to jump to the full documentation section for this control.

**How the three Help keys work together:**

| Key | What it does |
|-----|--------------|
| `F1` | Help on the currently focused control (context-sensitive) |
| `Ctrl+F1` | Open the full User Guide |
| `Shift+F1` | Open "What Can I Do Here?" for the active document context |

**Tips:**

- In the main editor, F1 shows editor shortcuts and writing tips.
- In dialogs (Preferences, Find/Replace, Spell Check, etc.), F1 identifies both the dialog and the specific setting.
- In the Personalise QUILL wizard, F1 on each control explains what each setting does and what you can change later.
- After using a menu and returning to the editor, QUILL remembers which control had focus last, so F1 still refers to the right control.

### Personalising QUILL

The **Personalise QUILL** wizard runs automatically the first time QUILL starts. You can re-run it at any time from **Help → Personalise QUILL**.

The wizard walks you through eight short pages:

1. **Welcome** — an introduction to what the wizard covers.
2. **Keyboard and Sound** — choose a keyboard pack and whether QUILL plays audio cues. QUILL auto-detects your screen reader and sets accessible defaults.
3. **Feature Profile** — choose a starting profile: Essential (minimal), Standard (recommended for most users), Power User (all features on), or Accessibility Focus (screen-reader optimised). You can switch profiles later.
4. **Remote Access** — enable or hide FTP, SFTP, WebDAV, and S3 remote file commands. Disabling this removes the remote-site menu items entirely, keeping the File menu clean.
5. **AI Assistance** — turn the AI writing assistant on or off. You can add an API key later; QUILL will prompt you when you first use an AI feature.
6. **Reading and Accessibility** — configure read-aloud behaviour and screen-reader announcement style.
7. **Writing Tools** — enable or disable spell-check-as-you-type, abbreviation expansion, and the Copy Tray.
8. **Startup Behaviour** — choose what QUILL opens when it starts and whether to check for updates automatically.
9. **Summary** — review all your choices before they are applied. Use Back to revise any page. Nothing changes in QUILL until you press Finish.

**Important:** The wizard is transactional. Your choices are held in memory until you press Finish. If you close or cancel the wizard, no settings are changed.

**Profiles explained:**

| Profile | Best for |
|---------|----------|
| Essential | New users, light daily writing, low-distraction setup |
| Standard | Most users — balanced feature set with AI and tools available |
| Power User | All features on; suited to advanced writing, extraction, and GLOW workflows |
| Accessibility Focus | Screen-reader primary; maximises keyboard coverage and announcements |

You can switch profiles at any time from **Tools → Customize & Support → Profiles and Features...** or by pressing `Alt+Shift+P`.

## Translation and Community Localization

QUILL uses a standard GNU gettext pipeline (`POT → PO → MO`) for all user-visible strings, aligned with the model used by NV Access for NVDA. This means QUILL translation work feels familiar to anyone who has contributed to NVDA, JAWS scripts, or other accessibility-focused open-source software.

### How the Translation Pipeline Works

1. **Source strings are marked in code** with `_()` for regular strings, `ngettext()` for plural forms, and `lazy_gettext()` for strings that must be translated at display time rather than at import time.
2. **The POT file** (`quill/locale/quill.pot`) is the master template, generated automatically by `pybabel extract`. It contains every translatable string in the application.
3. **PO files** (`quill/locale/<lang>/LC_MESSAGES/quill.po`) contain the actual translations for each language. Translators work in PO files.
4. **MO files** are compiled from PO files by `pybabel compile` and are the binary files QUILL loads at runtime.
5. **QUILL selects the active language** at startup from your `language` setting (BCP 47 tag, e.g., `fr`, `es`, `pt-BR`). If blank, QUILL follows the operating-system language.

Speech strings — text that will be read aloud by a screen reader rather than displayed visually — are marked with a `# SPEECH:` comment in the source code. Translators should preserve the natural spoken rhythm of these strings, not just their semantic meaning.

### Contributing Translations

To contribute a translation:

1. **Fork the QUILL repository** and create a branch named `l10n/<lang>` (e.g., `l10n/fr`).
2. **Copy `quill.pot` to your language folder:** `quill/locale/fr/LC_MESSAGES/quill.po`
3. **Translate each `msgid` into a `msgstr`.** Leave `msgstr` empty for strings you have not yet translated; the English fallback will be used.
4. **Run the CI translation check** to verify placeholder integrity and completeness: `python -m quill.tools.check_translation`
5. **Open a pull request.** The Translation Coordinator reviews and merges approved translations.

**Tools that help:**

- [Poedit](https://poedit.net/) — free, accessible PO file editor with spell check.
- [Virtaal](https://virtaal.translatehouse.org/) — lightweight alternative.
- Crowdin (when QUILL's project is live) — browser-based collaborative translation with a review queue.

**Do not translate:**

- Placeholder tokens: `{name}`, `%(count)s`, `{path}` — leave these exactly as they are in the `msgid`.
- ARIA role names: `"dialog"`, `"button"`, `"listbox"` — these are passed to platform accessibility APIs unchanged.
- Internal command identifiers: `"file.open"`, `"glow.audit"` — these are not user-visible.
- File extensions and format names: `.docx`, `EPUB`, `PDF`.

### Translation Roles and Responsibilities

QUILL follows a four-tier model aligned with NV Access community practice:

| Role | Responsibilities |
|------|----------------|
| **Translator** | Translate strings from English into the target language. |
| **Proofreader** | Review translations for accuracy, tone, and natural language flow. |
| **Language Coordinator** | Own quality for one language; approve or request changes from translators and proofreaders. |
| **Translation Coordinator** | Oversee the whole translation project, manage Crowdin, coordinate string freeze, credit contributors. |

To become a translator or proofreader: open a GitHub issue with the label `translation` and state the language you want to work on.

### Speech String Guidelines

QUILL marks screen-reader-targeted strings with `# SPEECH:` in the source code. When translating these strings:

- **Prioritise spoken clarity over literal accuracy.** A string that reads well when spoken aloud is more important than a string that is grammatically perfect but awkward when heard.
- **Match the rhythm.** Short speech strings should stay short. QUILL's screen-reader users hear these strings dozens of times per session; brevity is a form of accessibility.
- **Preserve emphasis signals.** Where the English string uses word order or phrasing to signal importance (e.g., the key word comes first), try to mirror that in translation.
- **Test with a screen reader.** If possible, test your translated strings with NVDA or JAWS before submitting.
- **Ask if unsure.** Open a GitHub issue tagged `translation` and `speech` if you are uncertain how a speech string should be adapted.

String freeze happens before each release candidate. No new strings are added after freeze, and translators have a two-week window to complete their language before the release is built.

## Checking for Updates

Quill can check for and install updates automatically while you work.

### Manual update check

To check for updates now:

1. Press Alt+H to open the **Help** menu.
2. Press U for **Check for Updates**.
3. If a newer version is available, Quill will announce it and ask for permission to download.
4. If you accept, Quill downloads the update in the background and announces when it is ready.
5. The next time you close and reopen Quill, the update is applied automatically.

### Automatic update checks

You can enable Quill to check for updates on startup:

1. Press Alt+E to open the **Edit** menu.
2. Press Shift+S for **Settings**.
3. In the **Updates** section, enable **Check for updates on startup**.

When automatic checks are on, Quill will notify you quietly if a new version is available, and you can choose to download it when you are ready.

### Update size and speed

Quill uses incremental updates ("micro-updates"), which are much smaller than full reinstalls. Patches often download in seconds rather than minutes, and your settings, documents, and preferences are preserved.

### Staying on a release channel

By default, Quill checks the stable update channel and only offers released versions. To opt into beta versions and test new features early, enable **Beta channel** in **Settings → Updates**.

## Beta Feedback and Bug Reporting

Quill is ready for serious beta use, and Quill 0.5.0 Beta now ships a real in-app support starting point.

### What exists today

Today, Quill already has the foundations for careful support work:

- recovery state
- notifications
- extraction review
- bad-extraction package export for extraction-related issues
- a general-purpose **Save Diagnostics...** command that writes a local bundle
- a **Report a Bug...** command that lets you review the report in-app and then opens the Community Access support-hub form with environment context
- a diagnostics runbook and PRD-backed support model in the documentation set

### What still needs to improve

Today, Quill still does **not** yet ship a polished no-login secure upload path directly from the desktop app, and the support handoff still depends on a browser form after the in-app review step.

### Best beta-launch recommendation

Before the broadest public rollout, publish one secure feedback route that does not require GitHub login. The best release-quality path is still:

1. a BITS-controlled HTTPS feedback form
2. optional upload of a user-reviewed diagnostics bundle
3. a plain-language bug template with environment summary and reproduction steps
4. the current **Help -> Report a Bug...** handoff kept as the guided in-app bridge until the fuller route is live

Until that exists, use the current Help-menu path as the practical bridge. The important improvement in Quill 0.5.0 Beta is that Quill now helps users gather diagnostics locally, review what is being shared, and start a structured support report without forcing them to begin outside the tool.

## A Fast Shortcut Tour

If you want a compact set of shortcuts to remember first, start here:

- `Ctrl+N`, `Ctrl+O`, `Ctrl+S`, `Ctrl+Shift+S`
- `Ctrl+Shift+P` for the Command Palette
- `Ctrl+F`, `F3`, `Shift+F3`, `Alt+F3`
- `Ctrl+G` and `Ctrl+Shift+G`
- `Ctrl+K` and `Ctrl+Enter`
- `Ctrl+Shift+Grave, L` for List Manager
- `F7`, `Alt+F7`, `Shift+F7`
- `Ctrl+Shift+W` for Word Count
- `Ctrl+Tab` and `Ctrl+Shift+Tab`
- `F6` and `Shift+F6`
- `Alt+Z` for soft wrap

Then open **Help → Open Keyboard Reference** and let Quill teach you the rest from your actual active layout.

## Closing Thought

The best way to understand Quill is to use it on something real: a note you care about, an extracted PDF that needs trust review, an EPUB chapter you want to navigate, a Markdown file you want to clean up, or an HTML document you want to make more usable.

Quill is trying to feel like a skilled guide sitting just beside the editor, not standing in front of it. If it succeeds, you will notice something simple: you spend less time wondering what the application can do, and more time deciding what you want to do next.

## Quillins: Sandboxed Extensions

Quill supports **Quillins** — small, sandboxed extensions that add new commands, snippets, and menu items to the editor without requiring a full app restart.

### Bundled Quillins
Quill ships with several trusted, first-party Quillins enabled by default. These provide common utilities that would otherwise clutter the core editor:

- **Text Tools**: Provides advanced text transformations and analysis, including:
  - **Line Numbering**: Prefix lines with sequential numbers.
  - **Hard Wrap**: Wrap text at a specific character width.
  - **Regular Expression Tools**: Count or extract patterns across the document.
  - **Block Filtering**: Find lines that are common to two blocks or exist only in the first.
- **Insert Tools**: Provides smart placeholders for quick insertion, such as the current **Date** and **Date/Time**.

### The Quillins Manager

Open via **Tools > Quillins**. The Manager lets you:

- See every installed Quillin and its current status (enabled or disabled).
- Select a Quillin to review its manifest: name, version, author, description, and declared capabilities.
- Enable or disable a Quillin without removing it.
- Remove a Quillin entirely (confirmation required).
- **Install from Folder** — press this button to select a local folder containing a Quillin. QUILL reads its `manifest.json`, validates it, copies the folder into your per-user extensions directory, and enables it immediately. If a Quillin with the same id is already installed it is replaced. This is the supported path for installing third-party Quillins.

When you select a Quillin, the panel shows all declared capabilities (for example `fs.read` or `net`). Review these before enabling an extension from an unknown source.

### Authoring Quillins
For developers, Quillins are designed to be "screen-reader-first." They follow a strict capability model: a Quillin must declare the minimum set of permissions it needs, and any sensitive action (like writing to a file) is consent-gated at runtime.

## AI Assistant

QUILL includes a built-in AI assistant. You can run it on-device (llama.cpp with a local GGUF model) or connect a provider: Ollama (local), Ollama Cloud, OpenAI, Claude, OpenRouter, Google Gemini, or a custom OpenAI-compatible endpoint. Providers are optional and selected explicitly. API keys are stored in the Windows Credential Manager by default, with a DPAPI-encrypted fallback, and never written to disk in plain text.

### Setting up an AI provider

Open **Tools > AI Assistant > AI Hub...** to configure your providers. The AI Hub is the single place for every provider's key, model, **Test Chat**, and per-provider key removal — the former **AI Model and Connection** and **Forget API Key** menu items were merged into it.

- **OpenRouter** — paste your API key into the OpenRouter API Key field. OpenRouter gives you access to many models (Claude, GPT-4o, Gemini, and more) with a single key.
- **OpenAI** — paste your OpenAI API key.
- **Ollama** — no key needed. Install Ollama on your machine (`ollama serve`) and QUILL detects it automatically at `http://localhost:11434`. Change the Ollama Base URL setting if you run Ollama on a different port or machine.

### Portable mode and key storage

By default QUILL stores AI provider keys in the **Windows Credential Manager**, which ties them to your Windows user account. If you run QUILL from a self-contained folder — for example on a network share or an external drive — you can switch to **portable mode** so all keys live in that same folder alongside your other QUILL data.

**Activating portable mode.** Set the environment variable `QUILL_PORTABLE=1` before starting QUILL. You can do this for the current session:

```powershell
$env:QUILL_PORTABLE = "1"
python -m quill
```

Or add it permanently to your user environment via System Properties > Environment Variables.

When portable mode is on, keys are stored in a file called `keys.enc` inside the QUILL data directory. The file is encrypted with Windows DPAPI, so it is protected by your Windows user-account key.

**Limitations.** The encrypted file is tied to the Windows account that created it. Moving it to a different machine or a different Windows account will fail to decrypt; you will need to re-enter your keys there. Portable mode gives you a self-contained folder on the same machine — it does not give you cross-machine portability.

**Environment-variable overrides (for CI and developers).** You can supply keys directly via environment variables regardless of which mode is active. These always win and are never stored to disk:

| Provider | Environment variable |
| --- | --- |
| OpenRouter | `QUILL_OPENROUTER_KEY` |
| OpenAI | `QUILL_OPENAI_KEY` |
| Ollama Cloud | `QUILL_OLLAMA_KEY` |
| AI Assistant | `QUILL_ASSISTANT_KEY` |

You can also set a **Default model for prompt runs** (`ai_prompt_default_model`). Leave it blank to share the same model across Ask AI and the Prompt Library, or set a different model here if you want a more capable model for prompt-library work.

### Ask AI (quick one-off question)

`Tools > AI Assistant > Ask AI...` opens a simple dialog where you type a question and read the answer without leaving QUILL. For the full conversational experience — with the active provider/model shown, in-dialog provider and model switching, and inserting replies into your document — use **Ask Quill Chat** on **Alt+Q** (see "Ask Quill Chat setup" above).

- **Provider** and **Model** choices are pre-filled with the last values you used.
- If a provider and model are already configured, focus lands directly in the Prompt field so you can start typing immediately. If not yet configured, focus starts on the Provider choice to guide you through setup.
- Press **Ctrl+Enter** or the **Send** button to submit. QUILL announces "Sending..." and disables the button while the request is in flight.
- The response opens in a read-only dialog. Use cursor keys to read it, and **Copy to Clipboard** to copy the full text. Closing the response returns you to the Ask AI dialog so you can ask a follow-up.
- **Clear** resets the prompt field and refocuses it.

### Check Grammar with AI

`Edit > Grammar > Check Grammar with AI` sends the selected text (or the full document if nothing is selected) to your AI model with a grammar-review prompt. The response dialog lists corrections in the form "original phrase → corrected phrase — reason". No changes are applied automatically; you apply corrections yourself.

The default grammar instruction is: review the text and list only the corrections needed; do not rewrite the passage. If you want a different instruction, open the Prompt Library, find the "Check Grammar" built-in prompt, and edit its text — the command picks up your version automatically.

### Prompt Library

`Tools > AI Assistant > Prompt Library...` opens the full prompt management dialog.

**What it shows.** A searchable list of all prompts on the left (type in the search field to filter by name or category). The selected prompt's instruction text on the right. An optional input text field where you can type or paste text to use as the selection context.

**Running a prompt.**
1. Select a prompt from the list (or type in the search field to find it).
2. Optionally paste text into the input field. If blank, QUILL uses the current editor selection or full document.
3. Press **Run with AI**. The result opens in the AI Response dialog.

**Managing prompts.**

- **New Prompt** — opens a small dialog: enter a name, choose a category, and write the instruction text. Use `{selection}` where you want QUILL to insert the text.
- **Edit** — modify the name, category, or instruction of a selected user prompt. Built-in prompts can have their text overridden (the override is saved; the original is never deleted).
- **Disable/Enable** — hides or shows a prompt in the list without deleting it. Useful for built-ins you never use.
- **Delete** — removes a user-created prompt. Built-in prompts cannot be deleted.

**Importing and exporting prompt packs.**

QUILL uses `.pqp` (Prompt Quill Pack) files to share prompt collections.

- **Import .pqp** — opens a file picker; imports all prompts from the file. Prompts whose names already exist in your library are skipped.
- **Export .pqp** — saves all your user-defined prompts to a `.pqp` file you can share or back up.

A `.pqp` file is plain JSON with a human-readable structure:

```json
{
  "schema": "quill.prompt-pack/1",
  "name": "My Writing Prompts",
  "prompts": [
    {
      "name": "Make Punchy",
      "text": "Rewrite this as a punchy one-liner: {selection}",
      "category": "Editing"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Built-in prompts.** QUILL ships 12 built-in prompts across five categories. These are always present and fully editable; they cannot be deleted.

| Category | Prompt names |
| --- | --- |
| Editing | Check Grammar, Improve Clarity, Fix Grammar, Make Concise, Active Voice, Formal Tone, Conversational Tone |
| Writing | Continue from Here |
| Structure | Convert to Bullet Points |
| Research | Define This Term, Find Counterarguments |

**Quillin-contributed prompts.** Quillins can ship a `prompts.json` file that adds prompts to the library. The bundled `ai-writing-prompts` Quillin contributes 7 additional prompts (Expand This, Vary Sentence Rhythm, Make More Vivid, Write a Title, Generate Outline, Suggest Supporting Evidence, Plain Language). These appear in the list and can be run like any other prompt; they are not persisted to your library file.

### Skill Library (.sqp skills)

Skills are multi-step AI workflows. Where a prompt is one instruction, a skill is a sequence of steps where each step can use the output of the step before it.

`Tools > AI Assistant > Skill Library...` opens the Skill Library dialog.

**What a skill looks like.** A skill has a name, a description, and a list of steps. Before running, QUILL shows a parameter dialog if the skill declares any parameters (such as tone, target reading level, or output format). Each step runs in order, sends its prompt to the AI, and stores the response for the next step to use.

**Bundled skills.** QUILL ships four skills in the `ai-writing-skills` Quillin:

- **Accessible Rewrite** — Analyses your text for plain-language issues (long sentences, passive voice, jargon), then produces a targeted rewrite. You choose the target reading level (Grade 6, 8, or 10). The rewritten text replaces the selection when you Accept.
- **Research and Draft** — Extracts the central topic from your selection, gathers five supporting facts, then drafts a paragraph at your chosen tone and length.
- **Meeting Notes to Action Items** — Reads meeting notes, extracts every action item with owner and deadline, checks for missed items, and produces a clean follow-up summary. Output goes to clipboard.
- **Argument Strengthener** — Identifies your argument's logical structure, finds weaknesses and counterarguments, then produces a strengthened version tailored to your chosen audience.

**Running a skill.**
1. Open `Tools > AI Assistant > Skill Library...`
2. Select a skill from the list.
3. Press **Run**. If the skill has parameters, a small dialog appears — fill in the choices and press OK.
4. QUILL announces "Running step 1 of N..." as each step executes.
5. When complete, the result dialog appears. Read the output, then press **Accept** to apply it (if the skill places output in the document) or **Copy** to copy to clipboard.

**No streaming.** Each step sends a complete prompt and waits for the full response before the next step begins. This makes step outputs reliable and readable between steps.

**Authoring and sharing skills.** A skill is a `.sqp` (Skill Quill Pack) file — a plain Markdown document with YAML front matter. Open any `.sqp` file in QUILL to read and edit it. Share skills by sharing the file. See `docs/quillins.md` §20 for the full authoring reference, and `docs/userguide.md` for a guided walkthrough.

**Validating a skill file.** Run `python -m quill.tools.sqp_validator yourskill.sqp` to check for errors before sharing or shipping.

## Control Reference

The Control Reference is a full listing of every focusable control in QUILL, organized by section. For each control it shows: what the control does, what keyboard shortcuts apply to it, and which section of this guide covers it in depth.

See [docs/CONTROL_REFERENCE.md](CONTROL_REFERENCE.md) for the full reference.

The reference is auto-generated from `quill/core/help/topics.json`. To regenerate it after adding new topics:

```powershell
python -m quill.tools.build_docs

# QUILL Developer Console Tutorial

Status: **Implemented in 0.5.0** (Developer and Power Text / Full QUILL profiles;
Tools > Power Tools > Developer Console). The Python console and the `q` scripting
API are wired; the TypeScript console runs via a Node subprocess. See the status
note at the top of this document for the exact `q` surface. (Some passages below
were written against the original 1.1 plan and may describe a richer API than the
current build; the status note is authoritative.)

---

## What the QDC is

The QUILL Developer Console (QDC) is an embedded scripting surface for
developers, power users, and accessibility professionals. It lets you inspect
and automate the running editor without rebuilding or adding temporary menu
items.

The QDC is not for ordinary users. It is profile-gated and off by default for
Essential, Writer, and Reader profiles. It appears as a first-class feature for
Developer and Power Text profiles.

There are two consoles:

- **Python console** — runs in-process. Full access to the scripting API via `q`.
  Prompt: `>>>` (continuation `...`).
- **TypeScript console** — runs through a Node subprocess bridge. Async API via
  `quill`. Prompt: `ts>` (async pending `ts*>`).

Both are read through the same transcript window and announced through QUILL's
standard accessibility announcement path.

---

## Opening the console

Menu: `Tools > Power Tools > Developer Console > Open Python Console`
or `Open TypeScript Console`.

Command palette: `quill.console.openPython` / `quill.console.openTypeScript`.

The console opens as a separate dialog. Press `Esc` to return focus to the
editor. The dialog stays open and preserves its namespace until you explicitly
close it.

---

## Console layout

The console has five areas, navigable with `F6`:

1. **Transcript** — read-only. Shows prompts, output, errors, and return values.
2. **Input** — single-line by default; `Shift+Enter` adds a newline for multi-line
   blocks.
3. **Language selector** — switch between Python and TypeScript.
4. **Status line** — current language, prompt state, active document, worker status.
5. **Buttons** — Run, Clear, Copy transcript, Save transcript, Insert snippet, Help, Close.

---

## Keyboard reference

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Enter | Execute current command |
| Shift+Enter | Insert newline (multi-line input) |
| Ctrl+Enter | Force execute multi-line block |
| Up / Down | Previous / next history (when cursor is at line boundary) |
| Ctrl+L | Clear transcript |
| Ctrl+Shift+C | Copy transcript |
| Ctrl+S | Save transcript |
| Ctrl+F | Find in transcript |
| F6 | Move between transcript, input, status, and buttons |
| Esc | Return focus to editor |
| F1 | Console help |
| Ctrl+Space | Trigger completion |

---

## Python console

### Available names

The following names are in scope when the console opens:

| Name | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `q` | Primary QUILL scripting API — start here |
| `app` | Application-level read-mostly object |
| `commands` | Command registry facade |
| `doc` | Active document snapshot |
| `editor` | Active editor snapshot |
| `sel` | Current selection snapshot |
| `caret` | Current caret snapshot |
| `profile` | Active feature profile snapshot |
| `settings` | Safe settings facade |
| `diagnostics` | Diagnostics facade |
| `a11y` | Announcement / testing facade |
| `log` | Console-safe logger |
| `wx` | wx module (Developer profile only) |

`doc`, `sel`, and `caret` are read-only snapshots of state at the time they were
captured. They do not update automatically. Call `q.refresh_context()` to pull
current state, or they update automatically when the active document changes.

### Basic operations

Insert text at the cursor:

```python
>>> q.insert_text("Hello from QUILL.")
```

Replace the current selection:

```python
>>> q.replace_selection("Replacement text")
```

Jump to a line:

```python
>>> q.goto_line(42)
```

Run a built-in command by ID:

```python
>>> q.run_command("quill.document.wordCount")
```

Send a screen-reader announcement:

```python
>>> q.a11y.announce("Test announcement.")
```

### Inspecting state

Read the active document name:

```python
>>> doc.name
'notes.txt'
```

Read the current selection:

```python
>>> sel.text
'selected words here'
```

Read the caret position (1-based line and column):

```python
>>> caret.line, caret.column
(12, 5)
```

Search for commands by keyword:

```python
>>> commands.search("spell")
['quill.spell.check', 'quill.spell.addWord', 'quill.spell.nextError']
```

Get a diagnostic summary (useful for support tickets):

```python
>>> q.support.diagnostic_summary()
```

### Accessibility diagnostics

Read the last screen-reader announcements:

```python
>>> q.a11y.last_announcements()
['Title Case applied', '5 words selected']
```

Describe the currently focused region:

```python
>>> q.focus.describe()
'Editor: notes.txt, line 12, col 5, no selection'
```

### Multi-line blocks

Use `Shift+Enter` to add newlines, then `Enter` or `Ctrl+Enter` to execute:

```python
>>> def count_words(text):
...     return len(text.split())
...
>>> count_words(doc.text)
487
```

### Macro recording

Record a sequence of commands as a reusable macro:

```python
>>> q.begin_macro("Clean OCR text")
>>> q.run_command("quill.text.normalizeUnicode")
>>> q.run_command("quill.text.dehyphenateLines")
>>> q.run_command("quill.text.reflowParagraphs")
>>> q.end_macro()
Macro saved: "Clean OCR text"
```

---

## TypeScript console

The TypeScript console requires Node.js on PATH. If Node.js is not found, QUILL
announces the requirement and offers installation assistance.

### TypeScript prompt behavior

```text
ts> await quill.insertText("Hello.");
ts*>
Result: undefined
```

`ts>` is the ready prompt. `ts*>` means an async operation is in flight. Results
and errors appear in the transcript automatically.

### Available globals

| Global | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `quill` | Async QUILL scripting proxy |
| `console` | Captured: `.log()`, `.warn()`, `.error()` appear in transcript |
| `setTimeout` / `clearTimeout` | Standard timer |
| `AbortController` | For cancellable operations |

### Basic operations

Insert text:

```ts
ts> await quill.insertText("Hello from TypeScript.");
```

Replace selection:

```ts
ts> await quill.replaceSelection("Replacement text");
```

Jump to a line:

```ts
ts> await quill.gotoLine(42);
```

Run a built-in command:

```ts
ts> await quill.runCommand("quill.markdown.normalizeHeadings");
```

### Inspecting state

```ts
ts> const doc = await quill.activeDocument();
ts> console.log(doc.name);
notes.txt
```

```ts
ts> const stats = await quill.documentStats();
ts> console.log(`${stats.words} words, ${stats.lines} lines`);
487 words, 38 lines
```

### Multi-line TypeScript

Use `Shift+Enter` to enter a multi-line block, `Ctrl+Enter` to execute:

```ts
ts> const text = await quill.getText();
ts> const words = text.trim().split(/\s+/).filter(Boolean);
ts> await quill.announce(`${words.length} words`);
```

### TypeScript type definitions

QUILL ships `quill-console.d.ts`. If you have Node.js and an IDE, copy it into
your project to get completion:

```ts
// quill is typed as:
interface QuillConsoleApi {
  insertText(text: string): Promise<void>;
  replaceSelection(text: string): Promise<void>;
  gotoLine(line: number): Promise<void>;
  runCommand(commandId: string, args?: Record<string, unknown>): Promise<unknown>;
  activeDocument(): Promise<QuillDocumentSnapshot>;
  documentStats(): Promise<QuillDocumentStats>;
  announce(text: string): Promise<void>;
}
```

---

## Screen-reader notes

- New output in the transcript is announced without stealing focus.
- Errors are announced with the prefix "Error".
- Return values are announced with the prefix "Result".
- Long output is summarized in the announcement; review the transcript with your
  screen reader for the full text.
- `Ctrl+Shift+C` copies the transcript at any time.
- The console uses QUILL's central Prism announcement path — the same one used
  by all other QUILL announcements.
- No custom-drawn controls are used.

---

## Console safety settings

`Tools > Power Tools > Developer Console > Console Safety Settings`
or command `quill.console.openSafetySettings`.

Settings:

| Setting | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Python console enabled | Profile-dependent | Off for Essential / Writer |
| TypeScript console enabled | Profile-dependent | Off except Developer profile |
| Require developer profile | On | Prevents accidental access in Writer profiles |
| Max execution time (Python) | 30 s | Hard kill after timeout |
| Max execution time (TypeScript) | 30 s | Worker restart after timeout |
| Allow `wx` module access | Developer profile only | Not available in any other profile |
| Remote console | Locked off | Not available in QUILL 1.x |

---

## Transcript commands

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `quill.console.copyTranscript` | Copy entire transcript to clipboard |
| `quill.console.saveTranscript` | Save transcript to a file |
| `quill.console.clear` | Clear the transcript |
| `quill.console.saveInputAsSnippet` | Save the current input as a named snippet |
| `quill.console.insertSnippet` | Insert a saved snippet into input |
| `quill.console.runSelection` | Run selected text in the transcript as a command |
| `quill.console.runCurrentDocument` | Run the active QUILL document as a script |
| `quill.console.showContext` | Print current snapshot values to transcript |
| `quill.console.resetNamespace` | Reset the Python namespace (clears all variables) |
| `quill.console.restartTypeScriptWorker` | Kill and restart the Node worker |

---

## For Quillin authors: testing your extension in the QDC

The QDC is a useful live test surface for Quillin development. Open the Python
console while your Quillin is loaded and explore its manifest and command
registry entry:

```python
>>> from quill.core.quillins.loader import get_loader
>>> loader = get_loader()
>>> ext = loader.get_extension("com.example.myextension")
>>> ext.manifest
ExtensionManifest(id='com.example.myextension', runtime='python', ...)
>>> ext.manifest.contributes.commands
(ExtensionCommand(id='ext.myext.run', title='My Command', ...),)
```

Invoke a command directly through the command registry:

```python
>>> q.run_command("ext.myext.run")
```

Inspect what a command announced:

```python
>>> q.a11y.last_announcements()
['My command completed: 3 items processed']
```

For Node.js Quillins, the TypeScript console is the natural test surface:

```ts
ts> await quill.runCommand("ext.myext.nodeHandler");
ts> // Check the last announcement
ts> const ann = await quill.lastAnnouncement();
ts> console.log(ann);
```

## Implementation status (0.5.0)

The QDC is implemented and reachable under the Developer and Power Text and
Full QUILL profiles (Tools > Power Tools > Developer Console). Shipped today:

- The Python console and console window (`quill/devtools/python_console.py`,
  `quill/devtools/console_window.py`) wired through `quill/ui/main_frame_devtools.py`.
- The TypeScript console via a Node subprocess (`quill/devtools/ts_console.py`,
  `quill/tools/ts_worker/worker.js`).
- The `q` scripting API (`quill/core/scripting.py`): the text/navigation/command
  methods plus the facades `q.selection`, `q.doc`, `q.editor`, `q.settings`,
  `q.profile`, `q.bookmarks`, `q.quillins`, `q.macros`
  (+`q.begin_macro`/`q.end_macro`), `q.spell`, `q.diagnostics`, and
  `q.a11y`/`q.commands`/`q.focus`/`q.support`, plus `q.describe_command`.

The scripting contract and its Implementation Status map live in
`docs/quillins.md`. Any passage above that still reads as "planned" predates
this build; the status note at the top of this document is authoritative.

# QUILL Developer Console and Automation API PRD

## Feature name

**QUILL Developer Console and Automation API**

## Status

Proposed for **QUILL 1.1**, with the Python console eligible for a 1.0 experimental/dev-preview flag if the command registry and announcement infrastructure are stable enough.

## Owner

Blind Information Technology Solutions (BITS) and Community Access

## Target platform

Windows 10 and Windows 11

## Target users

* QUILL developers
* QUILL power users
* Accessibility professionals
* Blind programmers and technical writers
* Macro authors
* Support/debugging users working with BITS or Community Access staff
* Future Quillins/plugin developers

## 1. Vision

QUILL should provide a screen-reader-first developer console that lets trusted users inspect and manipulate the running editor through a stable automation API.

The console is not an afterthought, a hidden debug hack, or a generic unsafe scripting surface. It is a first-class, accessible automation layer that exposes QUILL’s command system, document model, editor state, diagnostics, and accessibility announcement pipeline in a predictable way.

The goal is to let a developer or power user type commands such as:

```python
q.insert_text("Hello from QUILL.")
q.goto_line(42)
q.run_command("quill.document.wordCount")
q.run_command("quill.markdown.normalizeHeadings")
```

or, in TypeScript:

```ts
await quill.insertText("Hello from TypeScript.");
await quill.gotoLine(42);
const stats = await quill.documentStats();
console.log(stats.words);
```

Every editor-changing action must go through the QUILL command registry or official scripting API so undo, dirty-state tracking, accessibility announcements, status bar updates, telemetry, and tests remain consistent.

## 2. Problem statement

QUILL is becoming a rich writing and document environment with commands, macros, Quillins, profiles, diagnostics, GLOW integration, document intake, spell checking, format conversion, and accessibility-aware UI behavior.

Without a developer console and automation API:

* Developers must debug by adding temporary logging or breakpoints.
* Support staff cannot easily inspect user state during troubleshooting.
* Power users cannot automate repetitive editor actions.
* Macro support risks becoming a separate one-off system instead of using the same command architecture as the rest of QUILL.
* Future Quillins may lack a simple interactive testing surface.
* Accessibility professionals cannot quickly inspect document state, selection state, command availability, profile gating, or announcement behavior.

QUILL needs an embedded, accessible command line for trusted local development and automation.

## 3. Goals

1. Provide an accessible Python console inside the running QUILL app.
2. Provide a TypeScript automation console through a controlled Node subprocess bridge.
3. Expose a stable `q` / `quill` scripting object instead of raw internal objects.
4. Route all mutations through the command registry or official scripting API.
5. Preserve undo/redo, dirty-state tracking, backups, status bar updates, and screen-reader announcements.
6. Make console results easy to review with NVDA, JAWS, Narrator, braille displays, and keyboard-only workflows.
7. Support command history, multi-line input, copy/paste, saved snippets, and transcript export.
8. Gate the feature behind profiles and explicit settings so it does not surprise ordinary users.
9. Make the console useful for macro development, plugin development, support diagnostics, and test automation.
10. Never enable remote execution by default.

## 4. Non-goals

1. QUILL will not provide a public remote execution service in v1.
2. QUILL will not allow untrusted scripts to run silently.
3. QUILL will not expose arbitrary internal object mutation as the recommended workflow.
4. QUILL will not make Python or TypeScript scripting required for normal use.
5. QUILL will not replace a full IDE, debugger, or terminal.
6. QUILL will not guarantee sandbox security for arbitrary malicious code in the local Python console.
7. QUILL will not let scripts bypass document protection, source-file safety, cloud-consent prompts, or profile safety rules.

## 5. User stories

### 5.1 Developer

As a QUILL developer, I want to open a console, inspect the active document, run commands, and test editor behavior without rebuilding or adding temporary menu items.

Example:

```python
q.doc.name
q.selection.text
q.goto_line(100)
q.run_command("quill.find.next")
```

### 5.2 Accessibility tester

As an accessibility tester, I want to inspect the focused region, active command, current screen-reader announcement backend, and the last announcements so I can diagnose what a user experienced.

Example:

```python
q.a11y.last_announcements()
q.a11y.announce("Testing announcement path.")
q.focus.describe()
```

### 5.3 Macro author

As a power user, I want to experiment with commands interactively and save successful sequences as a macro.

Example:

```python
q.begin_macro("Clean OCR text")
q.run_command("quill.text.normalizeUnicode")
q.run_command("quill.text.dehyphenateLines")
q.run_command("quill.text.reflowParagraphs")
q.end_macro()
```

### 5.4 Support technician

As a support technician, I want a user to run a safe diagnostic command and copy the output into an email or support ticket.

Example:

```python
q.support.diagnostic_summary()
```

### 5.5 TypeScript user

As a developer more comfortable with TypeScript, I want to run async commands against QUILL using a typed API and receive clear errors.

Example:

```ts
const doc = await quill.activeDocument();
await quill.gotoLine(25);
console.log(doc.name);
```

## 6. Feature placement

Remote execution remains unavailable unless an experimental developer build explicitly enables it.

## 7. UX requirements

### 7.1 Console window layout

The console is a standard wx dialog or frame using stock controls.

Required controls:

1. **Transcript output**

   * Read-only multi-line `wx.TextCtrl`
   * Receives command output, errors, return values, announcements, and command prompts
   * Supports select all, copy, find, and save transcript

2. **Command input**

   * Editable `wx.TextCtrl`
   * Single-line by default
   * Multi-line mode available with a toggle or `Shift+Enter`
   * Enter runs the current command when the command is complete

3. **Language selector**

   * Python
   * TypeScript
   * Future: command-only mode

4. **Status line**

   * Shows current language, prompt state, active document, and worker status

5. **Buttons**

   * Run
   * Clear
   * Copy transcript
   * Save transcript
   * Insert snippet
   * Help
   * Close

### 7.2 Keyboard behavior

Required shortcuts:

| Shortcut     | Action                                                                                    |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Enter        | Execute current command                                                                   |
| Shift+Enter  | Insert newline in multi-line input                                                        |
| Ctrl+Enter   | Force execute multi-line command                                                          |
| Up/Down      | Previous/next command history when input cursor is at boundary                            |
| Ctrl+L       | Clear transcript                                                                          |
| Ctrl+Shift+C | Copy transcript                                                                           |
| Ctrl+S       | Save transcript                                                                           |
| Ctrl+F       | Find in transcript                                                                        |
| F6           | Move between transcript, input, status, and buttons                                       |
| Esc          | Return focus to editor if console is non-modal; close if modal confirmation is not needed |
| F1           | Open console help                                                                         |
| Ctrl+Space   | Trigger completion if available                                                           |
| Tab          | Insert indentation in multi-line mode or move focus depending on setting                  |

### 7.3 Screen-reader behavior

The console must be fully usable with NVDA, JAWS, and Narrator.

Requirements:

* Every control has a clear accessible name.
* The transcript announces new output without stealing focus.
* Errors are announced with the prefix “Error”.
* Return values are announced with the prefix “Result”.
* Long output is not automatically spoken in full; the console announces a summary and lets the user review the transcript.
* The console supports a “copy last result” command.
* The console supports a “speak last result” command.
* The console uses QUILL’s central announcement path.
* Braille users can review the transcript as plain text.
* No custom drawn controls are allowed in the primary console workflow.

### 7.4 Prompt behavior

Python prompt:

```text
>>>
```

Continuation prompt:

```text
...
```

TypeScript prompt:

```text
ts>
```

Async TypeScript pending prompt:

```text
ts*>
```

The prompt itself is included in the transcript but not required in copied code unless the user chooses “Copy with prompts”.

## 8. Python console requirements

### 8.1 Execution model

The Python console runs in-process and uses Python’s embedded interpreter facilities.

The console maintains a persistent namespace for the session. Hiding the console does not destroy the namespace unless the user explicitly resets it.

### 8.2 Default namespace

The following names are available by default:

```python
q              # Primary QUILL scripting API
app            # Application-level read-mostly object
frame          # Main frame, available for debugging
commands       # Command registry read/execute facade
doc            # Active document snapshot
editor         # Active editor snapshot
sel            # Current selection snapshot
caret          # Current caret snapshot
profile        # Active feature profile snapshot
settings       # Safe settings facade
diagnostics    # Diagnostics facade
a11y           # Announcement/testing facade
log            # Console-safe logger
wx             # wx module, developer profile only
```

### 8.3 Snapshot refresh

The console updates snapshot variables when:

* The console opens.
* The active document changes.
* The user runs `q.refresh_context()`.
* A command changes editor state.
* The user chooses “Refresh Console Context”.

Snapshot variables such as `doc`, `sel`, and `caret` are safe read-only snapshots unless explicitly documented otherwise.

### 8.4 Python examples

```python
q.insert_text("Hello from QUILL.")
```

```python
q.replace_selection("Replacement text")
```

```python
q.goto_line(42)
```

```python
q.run_command("quill.document.wordCount")
```

```python
q.a11y.announce("This is a test announcement.")
```

```python
q.diagnostics.document_summary()
```

```python
q.commands.search("spell")
```

## 9. TypeScript console requirements

### 9.1 Execution model

The TypeScript console runs out-of-process through a Node worker.

Python QUILL process:

* Owns the editor, document model, command registry, and UI thread.
* Sends TypeScript code to the Node worker.
* Receives JSON-RPC-style command requests from the worker.
* Executes approved commands on the wx main thread.
* Returns structured results or errors.

Node TypeScript worker:

* Receives TypeScript code.
* Transpiles it to JavaScript.
* Executes it with a limited `quill` proxy object.
* Sends editor actions back to Python as structured requests.
* Captures `console.log`, warnings, errors, and return values.

### 9.2 TypeScript global API

The TypeScript console exposes:

```ts
quill
console
setTimeout
clearTimeout
AbortController
```

The TypeScript worker must not expose unrestricted filesystem, network, process, or shell access through the default console environment.

### 9.3 TypeScript examples

```ts
await quill.insertText("Hello from TypeScript.");
```

```ts
await quill.replaceSelection("Replacement text");
```

```ts
await quill.gotoLine(42);
```

```ts
const stats = await quill.documentStats();
console.log(`${stats.words} words`);
```

```ts
await quill.runCommand("quill.markdown.normalizeHeadings");
```

### 9.4 Type definitions

QUILL ships a `quill-console.d.ts` type definition file so TypeScript users get completion and documentation.

Example:

```ts
interface QuillConsoleApi {
  insertText(text: string): Promise<void>;
  replaceSelection(text: string): Promise<void>;
  gotoLine(line: number): Promise<void>;
  runCommand(commandId: string, args?: Record<string, unknown>): Promise<unknown>;
  activeDocument(): Promise<QuillDocumentSnapshot>;
  documentStats(): Promise<QuillDocumentStats>;
  announce(text: string, options?: AnnouncementOptions): Promise<void>;
}
```

### 9.5 Worker lifecycle

The TypeScript worker starts only when the TypeScript console is opened.

The worker stops when:

* QUILL exits.
* The user closes the console and worker idle timeout expires.
* The user chooses “Restart TypeScript Worker”.
* The worker exceeds memory or time limits.
* The worker crashes.

Worker crashes must not crash QUILL.

## 10. QUILL scripting API

### 10.1 API principles

The scripting API is the official automation surface.

Rules:

1. Mutations go through the command registry.
2. Undo/redo must work.
3. Dirty state must update.
4. Status bar must update.
5. Screen-reader announcements must happen.
6. Profile and feature gates must be respected.
7. Cloud/network actions must still ask for consent.
8. Protected originals must stay protected.
9. Commands must return structured results.
10. Errors must be plain-language first, traceback second.

### 10.2 Python API shape

```python
class QuillScriptAPI:
    def insert_text(self, text: str) -> None: ...
    def replace_selection(self, text: str) -> None: ...
    def selected_text(self) -> str: ...
    def document_text(self) -> str: ...
    def set_document_text(self, text: str) -> None: ...
    def goto_line(self, line: int) -> None: ...
    def goto_offset(self, offset: int) -> None: ...
    def run_command(self, command_id: str, **kwargs): ...
    def command_exists(self, command_id: str) -> bool: ...
    def list_commands(self, query: str | None = None) -> list[CommandInfo]: ...
    def active_document(self) -> DocumentSnapshot: ...
    def document_stats(self) -> DocumentStats: ...
    def refresh_context(self) -> None: ...
```

### 10.3 TypeScript API shape

```ts
interface QuillApi {
  insertText(text: string): Promise<void>;
  replaceSelection(text: string): Promise<void>;
  selectedText(): Promise<string>;
  documentText(): Promise<string>;
  setDocumentText(text: string): Promise<void>;
  gotoLine(line: number): Promise<void>;
  gotoOffset(offset: number): Promise<void>;
  runCommand(commandId: string, args?: Record<string, unknown>): Promise<unknown>;
  commandExists(commandId: string): Promise<boolean>;
  listCommands(query?: string): Promise<CommandInfo[]>;
  activeDocument(): Promise<DocumentSnapshot>;
  documentStats(): Promise<DocumentStats>;
  refreshContext(): Promise<void>;
}
```

### 10.4 Safe facades

The console exposes safe facades instead of raw internals wherever possible.

Required facades:

* `q.documents`
* `q.editor`
* `q.selection`
* `q.commands`
* `q.bookmarks`
* `q.search`
* `q.spell`
* `q.markdown`
* `q.text`
* `q.a11y`
* `q.diagnostics`
* `q.profile`
* `q.settings`
* `q.support`
* `q.macros`
* `q.quillins`

## 11. Command registry integration

Every console-callable command must declare metadata:

```python
Command(
    id="quill.editor.insertText",
    title="Insert Text",
    description="Insert text at the current caret position.",
    handler=insert_text_handler,
    default_key=None,
    when="editorFocus",
    scriptable=True,
    mutates_document=True,
    undo_group="typing",
    requires_consent=False,
    profile_feature="developer.console",
)
```

Required metadata fields for scriptable commands:

* `id`
* `title`
* `description`
* `scriptable`
* `mutates_document`
* `undo_group`
* `requires_consent`
* `profile_feature`
* `privacy_label`
* `network_label`
* `return_schema`
* `argument_schema`

The console refuses to run commands marked `scriptable=False` unless developer unsafe mode is enabled.

## 12. Macro integration

The console is the fastest path to creating and testing macros.

Requirements:

* Users can save selected console history as a macro.
* Macros are stored as command sequences by default, not arbitrary Python code.
* Python macros are developer-profile-only.
* TypeScript macros are developer-profile-only.
* Command-sequence macros are allowed in more profiles.
* Macro execution shows a preview when it will modify the document.
* Macro execution is one undo group unless the macro author explicitly splits undo groups.
* Macro failures stop execution and announce the failed step.

Example command-sequence macro:

```json
{
  "name": "Clean OCR text",
  "steps": [
    {"command": "quill.text.normalizeUnicode"},
    {"command": "quill.text.dehyphenateLines"},
    {"command": "quill.text.reflowParagraphs"}
  ]
}
```

## 13. Security and safety

### 13.1 Local trust model

The Python console is trusted local code execution.

QUILL must clearly warn users:

```text
The Developer Console can run code inside QUILL.
Only run commands you understand or received from a trusted source.
```

This warning appears:

* The first time the console opens.
* When enabling the feature from Settings.
* When pasting multi-line code from the clipboard.
* When attempting to enable unsafe developer mode.

### 13.2 Remote execution

Remote execution is locked off by default.

Requirements:

* No listening socket in stable builds.
* No hidden remote console.
* No command-line flag that silently enables remote execution.
* Experimental remote console, if ever added, must bind to localhost only by default.
* Remote console must require an explicit one-time token.
* Remote console must show a persistent status bar warning.
* Remote console must auto-disable on restart unless the user explicitly chooses otherwise.

### 13.3 Dangerous operations

The console must prompt or block for:

* Running shell commands
* Reading arbitrary files outside allowed locations
* Writing arbitrary files outside QUILL-controlled flows
* Sending document content to network services
* Installing Quillins
* Changing profile safety rules
* Disabling backups or crash recovery
* Accessing protected source documents
* Running pasted multi-line code

### 13.4 TypeScript worker limits

Default limits:

| Limit                  | Default                     |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Execution timeout      | 30 seconds                  |
| Idle timeout           | 10 minutes                  |
| Memory warning         | 256 MB                      |
| Memory hard limit      | 512 MB                      |
| Output flood threshold | 100 KB                      |
| Max transcript size    | 5 MB before rotation prompt |

Long-running TypeScript scripts must support cancellation.

## 14. Accessibility requirements

The console must pass QUILL’s normal accessibility gates.

Required tests:

* NVDA reads console controls correctly.
* JAWS reads console controls correctly.
* Narrator reads console controls correctly.
* F6 cycles through console regions.
* Escape behavior is predictable.
* New output does not steal focus.
* Long output is summarized.
* Errors are reviewable character-by-character.
* Braille display review works through the transcript control.
* High contrast mode remains readable.
* Large font mode does not clip prompts or buttons.
* Keyboard-only users can run, copy, save, clear, and close.
* No console action traps focus.

## 15. Error handling

Errors appear in three layers:

1. Plain-language summary
2. Actionable suggestion
3. Technical details, expandable or copyable

Example:

```text
Error: Unknown command "quill.markdown.fixHeading".
Suggestion: Run q.commands.search("heading") to find matching commands.
Details: CommandNotFoundError: quill.markdown.fixHeading
```

Python tracebacks are available but collapsed behind “Show technical details” unless the active profile is Developer and Power Text.

TypeScript stack traces are captured and mapped to the user’s submitted code when possible.

## 16. Logging and transcripts

The console keeps a local transcript of:

* Commands entered
* Results
* Errors
* Warnings
* Announcements triggered by console commands
* Worker lifecycle events
* Macro recording markers

Privacy requirements:

* Transcripts are not sent anywhere automatically.
* Document text is included only when commands print or return it.
* “Copy diagnostic summary” redacts document content by default.
* Users can save transcripts manually.
* Support packages ask before including transcript content.

## 17. Settings

Settings page: `Settings > Developer Console and Automation`

Settings:

## 18. Data storage

Suggested files:

```text
%APPDATA%\Quill\console\
  history.jsonl
  snippets.json
  transcripts\
  types\
    quill-console.d.ts
  ts-worker\
    worker.js
```

Portable mode stores the same structure next to the portable QUILL configuration directory.

History entries contain:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2026-06-10T00:00:00Z",
  "language": "python",
  "input": "q.document_stats()",
  "success": true
}
```

History must not store command output by default.

## 19. Technical architecture

### 19.1 New modules

```text
quill/
  core/
    scripting.py              Official QuillScriptAPI facade
    script_context.py         Active console context snapshots
    script_permissions.py     Console permission checks
    script_results.py         Structured result and error models
  devtools/
    console_window.py         wx console UI
    python_console.py         Embedded Python console
    ts_console.py             Python-side TypeScript bridge
    ts_worker_protocol.py     JSON-RPC message schema
    completions.py            Completion provider
    history.py                Console history manager
    snippets.py               Snippet manager
    transcripts.py            Transcript manager
  tools/
    ts_worker/
      worker.ts               TypeScript worker source
      worker.js               Built worker
      quill-console.d.ts      Type definitions
```

### 19.2 Threading model

Rules:

* UI mutations must run on the wx main thread.
* Console input handling may occur in the UI thread only for quick commands.
* Long commands must run as background tasks.
* TypeScript worker communication runs asynchronously.
* Results are marshaled back to the UI through QUILL’s event queue or `wx.CallAfter`.
* Command cancellation must be supported for long-running tasks.

### 19.3 Command execution flow

```text
User enters command
    ↓
Console parser receives input
    ↓
Python console or TypeScript worker executes code
    ↓
Code calls q / quill API
    ↓
API validates permission, profile, and command metadata
    ↓
Command registry executes command
    ↓
Document/editor/status/a11y systems update
    ↓
Structured result returns to console
    ↓
Transcript updates and concise result is announced
```

## 20. Completion and help

The console should provide discoverability without requiring users to memorize APIs.

Completion sources:

* `q` methods
* command ids
* active document properties
* macro names
* snippet names
* settings keys
* feature ids

Help commands:

```python
q.help()
q.help("insert_text")
q.commands.search("bookmark")
q.describe_command("quill.editor.gotoLine")
q.examples("markdown")
```

TypeScript equivalents:

```ts
await quill.help();
await quill.commands.search("bookmark");
await quill.describeCommand("quill.editor.gotoLine");
```

## 21. Testing strategy

### 21.1 Unit tests

* `QuillScriptAPI.insert_text` routes through command registry.
* `replace_selection` creates one undoable operation.
* `goto_line` rejects invalid line numbers with plain-language errors.
* `run_command` refuses non-scriptable commands.
* Profile gates hide or reject console commands properly.
* Permission checks block dangerous operations.
* Snapshot refresh updates document, selection, and caret state.
* TypeScript protocol serializes and deserializes results correctly.
* Worker crash returns a structured error.

### 21.2 Integration tests

* Open Python console, run `q.insert_text`, verify document changes.
* Run document-wide command, verify undo restores prior state.
* Run command that announces result, verify announcement transcript.
* Open TypeScript console, run `await quill.insertText(...)`.
* Restart TypeScript worker and verify QUILL stays alive.
* Save console history as macro and run macro.
* Copy diagnostic summary and verify redaction.
* Paste multi-line code and verify confirmation prompt.

### 21.3 Accessibility tests

* NVDA reads transcript and input controls.
* JAWS reads transcript and input controls.
* Narrator reads transcript and input controls.
* F6 region cycling works.
* Escape returns focus predictably.
* High contrast and large fonts work.
* Long output does not cause speech flood.
* Error details are reachable and copyable.

### 21.4 Security tests

* Remote execution is not listening in stable builds.
* TypeScript worker cannot directly access unrestricted shell by default.
* Console cannot bypass network consent.
* Console cannot silently overwrite protected source documents.
* Pasted multi-line execution triggers confirmation.
* Unsafe developer mode cannot be enabled by imported profile alone.

## 22. Success criteria

The feature is successful when:

1. A developer can open the Python console and inspect/manipulate the active document through `q`.
2. A TypeScript user can run async editor commands through `quill`.
3. All document mutations are undoable.
4. Screen-reader users can operate the console without custom scripts.
5. Console commands respect profile, permission, and consent rules.
6. Long or failed commands do not crash QUILL.
7. TypeScript worker crashes do not crash QUILL.
8. Support diagnostics can be copied without leaking document content by default.
9. Macro creation can reuse console command history.
10. CI covers unit, integration, accessibility, and safety behavior.

## 23. MVP scope

2. Should the console be modal, non-modal, or dockable?
3. Should command history persist by default or require opt-in?
4. Should TypeScript support be bundled or require Node detection?
5. Should a minimal embedded JS engine be considered later for users who do not have Node?
6. Should console snippets sync with macros, or remain separate?
7. Should support technicians have a restricted “diagnostics-only console” mode?
8. Should unsafe developer mode require a launch flag in addition to a setting?
9. Should QUILL ship sample scripts for OCR cleanup, Markdown repair, and diagnostics?
10. Should console transcript export support Markdown, plain text, and JSON?

## 25. Example first-run warning

```text
Developer Console

This console can run commands inside QUILL and may change the current document.
Only run commands you understand or received from a trusted source.

Recommended:
- Use q.run_command(...) or documented q methods.
- Do not paste code from unknown sources.
- Save your document before running document-wide commands.

[Open Console] [Cancel] [Learn More]
```

## 26. Example diagnostic summary command

Python:

```python
q.support.diagnostic_summary()
```

Output:

```text
QUILL diagnostic summary
Version: 1.1.0-dev
Profile: Developer and Power Text
Active document: chapter-7.md
Modified: yes
Documents open: 3
Screen reader detected: NVDA
Announcement backend: auto
Python console: enabled
TypeScript console: available
Last command: quill.editor.gotoLine
Last error: none
Document content included: no
```

## 27. Definition of done

This feature is done when:

* The Python console is fully keyboard accessible.
* The Python console exposes the official `q` scripting API.
* TypeScript console runs through a subprocess bridge and cannot crash QUILL.
* All editor mutations go through the command registry or scripting API.
* Undo/redo, dirty-state, status bar, and accessibility announcements remain correct after console-driven changes.
* Profile gating and safety settings work.
* First-run safety warnings are present.
* Console history, transcript copy, and transcript save work.
* Dangerous actions require confirmation or are blocked.
* Automated tests cover command execution, accessibility, worker failure, permissions, and undo behavior.
* User documentation explains examples, risks, and safe patterns.

# Writing Skills for QUILL — A Tutorial

This guide teaches you to write, validate, and share `.sqp` (Skill Quill Pack) files.
A skill is a multi-step AI workflow written in plain Markdown. If you can write a
prompt, you can write a skill.

---

## 1. What is a skill?

A QUILL prompt is one instruction. A skill is a conversation — a series of instructions
where each step can see what the previous step produced.

You might use a skill when:

- You want to analyse your text first, then act on the analysis.
- You want to gather information in one step and draft with it in the next.
- You want to check a condition (is this a question or a statement?) and take a
  different path depending on the answer.
- You want to repeat the same sub-task at a higher quality by giving the model
  context it built in an earlier step.

---

## 2. Your first skill

Create a file called `my-first-skill.sqp` and open it in QUILL.

```markdown
---
schema: quill.skill/1
name: Explain Then Simplify
description: Explains the selected text in plain terms, then simplifies it further.
author: Your Name
version: 1.0.0
---

# Step 1: Explain

Explain the following text as if the reader has no prior knowledge. Use simple
vocabulary and short sentences. Aim for 50-80 words.

Text to explain:
{selection}

# Step 2: Simplify further

The explanation below is good, but we need it even simpler. Rewrite it so a
twelve-year-old would understand it immediately. Keep the core meaning.

Explanation to simplify:
{step1.output}

```output
format: text
label: Plain-language explanation
accept_into: clipboard
```
```

Save the file, then validate it:

```powershell
python -m quill.tools.sqp_validator my-first-skill.sqp
```

You should see:

```
my-first-skill.sqp: OK
```

---

## 3. Adding parameters

Parameters let users choose options before the skill runs. QUILL shows a small dialog
collecting the choices before step 1 begins.

Add a reading-level choice to the skill above:

```markdown
---
schema: quill.skill/1
name: Explain Then Simplify
description: Explains and simplifies selected text at a chosen reading level.
author: Your Name
version: 1.0.0
parameters:
  - name: level
    label: Target reading level
    type: choice
    choices: [Grade 4, Grade 6, Grade 8]
    default: Grade 6
---

# Step 1: Explain

Explain the following text so it is accessible at {parameters.level} reading level.
Use simple vocabulary and short sentences. Aim for 50-80 words.

Text to explain:
{selection}

# Step 2: Simplify further

Rewrite the explanation below to be even clearer. Target: {parameters.level}.
Keep the core meaning intact.

{step1.output}

```output
format: text
label: Plain-language explanation
accept_into: clipboard
```
```

Now the parameter `{parameters.level}` is available in both steps. The value
comes from the user's choice in the dialog.

**Parameter types.**

| Type | UI control | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `text` | Single-line text field | A keyword or name |
| `multiline` | Multi-line text area | A block of context |
| `choice` | Drop-down list | Reading level, tone, language |
| `bool` | Checkbox | Include citations: yes/no |
| `number` | Numeric field | Word count target |

---

## 4. Using the input block

Long texts can clutter the prompt. The `input` block appends data after the
instruction text, keeping the step prose readable:

```markdown
# Step 1: Extract key claims

Read the following document and list the five most important claims it makes.
Number each claim. One sentence per claim.

```input
{document}
```
```

Without the `input` block you would write:

```markdown
# Step 1: Extract key claims

Read the following document and list the five most important claims it makes.
Number each claim. One sentence per claim.

Document:
{document}
```

Both are equivalent; the `input` block is just cleaner when the data is long.

---

## 5. Conditional branching

Use a `condition` block to route execution based on a step's output.

```markdown
# Step 1: Detect intent

Read the following text. Is it asking a question, or making a statement?
Answer with exactly one word: "question" or "statement".

```input
{selection}
```

```condition
if: "{step1.output}" contains "question"
then: step2
else: step3
```

# Step 2: Answer the question

Answer this question clearly and concisely:
{selection}

```output
format: text
label: Answer
accept_into: clipboard
```

# Step 3: Expand the statement

Expand the following statement into a full paragraph with supporting detail:
{selection}

```output
format: text
label: Expanded statement
accept_into: clipboard
```
```

**How it works.** After step 1 runs, QUILL checks the condition: if the output
contains "question", it jumps to step 2. Otherwise, it jumps to step 3. Whichever
step runs last is the one that produces the output.

**Supported operators.**

| Operator | Matches when |
| --- | --- |
| `contains` | Subject contains value (case-insensitive) |
| `equals` | Subject exactly matches value (case-insensitive) |
| `starts_with` | Subject starts with value |
| `ends_with` | Subject ends with value |
| `length_gt` | Subject length > number |
| `length_lt` | Subject length < number |
| `is_empty` | Subject is blank |

---

## 6. Controlling the output

The `output` block on the last step controls what happens to the result.

```markdown
```output
format: text
label: Rewritten paragraph
accept_into: selection
```
```

**`format`:** `text` (default), `list` (AI should return a bulleted or numbered
list), `json` (AI should return valid JSON).

**`accept_into`:** What happens when the user presses Accept in the result dialog.
- `selection` — replaces the current editor selection.
- `clipboard` — copies to clipboard.
- `none` — shows read-only (default).

The `label` appears in the result dialog header so the user knows what they are
reviewing.

---

## 7. A complete example — Accessible Rewrite

Here is the bundled "Accessible Rewrite" skill in full, with commentary.

```markdown
---
schema: quill.skill/1
name: Accessible Rewrite
description: Rewrites selected text for plain-language accessibility.
author: QUILL Project
version: 1.0.0
parameters:
  - name: reading_level
    label: Target reading level
    type: choice
    choices: [Grade 6, Grade 8, Grade 10, No target]
    default: Grade 8
---

# Step 1: Analyse accessibility issues

Review the following text for plain-language accessibility issues. List the
problems as a numbered list. Focus on: sentence length (over 25 words), passive
voice, unexplained jargon or acronyms, abstract nouns where concrete ones would
serve better, and complex nested clauses. Be concise — one clear problem per
line. If the text has no issues, say "No issues found."

```input
{selection}
```

# Step 2: Rewrite for accessibility

Rewrite the text below to fix the issues identified in Step 1. Requirements:
- Target reading level: {parameters.reading_level}
- Preserve all factual content
- Do not add new information

Original text:
{selection}

Issues to fix:
{step1.output}

```output
format: text
label: Rewritten text
accept_into: selection
```
```

**Step 1** analyses the text and produces a numbered list of issues.
**Step 2** uses `{step1.output}` (the issue list) as context alongside the
original text, so the model knows exactly what to fix. The output replaces the
selection when the user presses Accept.

---

## 8. Validating your skill

Always run the validator before sharing:

```powershell
python -m quill.tools.sqp_validator my-skill.sqp
```

For extra checks:

```powershell
python -m quill.tools.sqp_validator my-skill.sqp --strict
```

`--strict` also warns if `description` or `author` are missing.

**Common errors and how to fix them.**

| Error | Cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `schema must be 'quill.skill/1'` | Missing or wrong schema | Add `schema: quill.skill/1` to front matter |
| `front matter must include 'name'` | No `name:` field | Add `name: My Skill` |
| `must have at least one step` | No `# Heading` lines | Add at least one `# Step N:` heading |
| `{step3.output} references a step that hasn't run yet` | Forward reference | Steps can only reference outputs from earlier steps |
| `unknown parameter 'tone'` | Used `{parameters.tone}` but didn't declare it | Add `tone` to the `parameters` list in front matter |
| `output format 'xml' is invalid` | Bad `format:` value | Use `text`, `list`, or `json` |

---

## 9. Sharing skills

A `.sqp` file is a plain text file — share it the same way you share any document.

**Via the Skill Library.** When someone receives your `.sqp` file, they import it
through `Tools > AI Assistant > Skill Library > Import .sqp`.

**Via a Quillin.** If you maintain a Quillin, add your `.sqp` files to the Quillin
directory. QUILL discovers them automatically at Skill Library load time.

**As a standalone file.** A `.sqp` file is self-contained. The recipient can also
open it in QUILL's editor to read, understand, and customise every step.

---

## 10. Skill authoring tips

**Keep step instructions specific.** "List the five most important claims" is
better than "What are the claims?" The model follows precision.

**Name outputs explicitly.** Instead of "Summarise the following", write "Write a
one-sentence summary of the following text. Return only the summary sentence,
no preamble." This ensures `{step1.output}` contains exactly what you expect.

**Test with short text first.** Paste two or three sentences into the editor,
select them, and run the skill. Short inputs are faster and errors are easier to
trace.

**Use `input` blocks for long data.** If your selection might be a full document,
put `{document}` in an `input` block rather than inline in the prompt. The step
reads more cleanly.

**Put conditions after a clean-detection step.** If you are branching on whether
text is a question, a statement, a list, or something else, dedicate step 1 to
just that classification. Ask for a single-word answer. The more constrained the
output, the more reliably the condition evaluates.

**Use the output block's `accept_into` intentionally.** If the skill rewrites the
selection, use `accept_into: selection`. If it produces supplementary content
(meeting summary, outline), use `accept_into: clipboard` so the user can paste
where they choose. Use `none` for informational skills (grammar analysis,
readability score) where the result is read but not inserted.

## Reference card

**Front matter fields.**

| Field | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `schema: quill.skill/1` | yes | — |
| `name: ...` | yes | — |
| `description: ...` | recommended | `""` |
| `author: ...` | recommended | `""` |
| `version: ...` | no | `1.0.0` |
| `parameters: [...]` | no | `[]` |

**Variables.**

| Variable | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `{selection}` | Selected editor text (full document if nothing selected) |
| `{document}` | Full document text |
| `{title}` | Document title |
| `{clipboard}` | Clipboard text at skill-start time |
| `{stepN.output}` | Output from step N (must be a lower-numbered step) |
| `{parameters.name}` | Value of a declared parameter |

**Fenced block types.**

| Block | Where | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `` `input` `` | Any step | Appends data to the prompt |
| `` `condition` `` | Any step | Branch to `then`/`else` step after this step runs |
| `` `output` `` | Last step | Controls format, label, accept_into |
| `` `use-prompt` `` | Any step | Delegates to a named Prompt Library prompt |

**Condition operators.** `contains`, `equals`, `starts_with`, `ends_with`,
`length_gt`, `length_lt`, `is_empty`.

# Copy Tray

## Overview

Copy Tray gives you nine independently addressable clipboard slots. Each slot
holds a piece of text that you copy there explicitly. Slots survive application
restarts — their contents are written to disk automatically so nothing is lost
when you close and reopen QUILL.

Unlike the system clipboard, which is shared with every other application and
holds only the most recently copied item, Copy Tray slots are exclusive to
QUILL and hold their contents until you explicitly replace or clear them. This
makes Copy Tray well suited for accumulating related fragments across a long
editing session: quotes from multiple sources, code snippets, address blocks,
standard disclaimers, or any text you paste repeatedly.

## Keyboard Access

### Paste from a slot

Hold `Ctrl+Shift` and press a number key. That is all.

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `Ctrl+Shift+1` | Paste from slot 1 at cursor |
| `Ctrl+Shift+2` | Paste from slot 2 at cursor |
| `Ctrl+Shift+3` | Paste from slot 3 at cursor |
| `Ctrl+Shift+4` | Paste from slot 4 at cursor |
| `Ctrl+Shift+5` | Paste from slot 5 at cursor |
| `Ctrl+Shift+6` | Paste from slot 6 at cursor |
| `Ctrl+Shift+7` | Paste from slot 7 at cursor |
| `Ctrl+Shift+8` | Paste from slot 8 at cursor |
| `Ctrl+Shift+9` | Paste from slot 9 at cursor |

If a selection is active when you paste, the pasted text replaces it.
If the slot is empty, QUILL announces "Slot N is empty".

### Copy to a slot

Hold the QUILL key (`Ctrl+Shift+Grave`), release, then press `Shift+digit`.
The QUILL-key bare digits 1-6 are heading shortcuts; adding Shift is a distinct
binding with no conflict.

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `Ctrl+Shift+Grave, Shift+1` | Copy selection to slot 1 |
| `Ctrl+Shift+Grave, Shift+2` | Copy selection to slot 2 |
| `Ctrl+Shift+Grave, Shift+3` | Copy selection to slot 3 |
| `Ctrl+Shift+Grave, Shift+4` | Copy selection to slot 4 |
| `Ctrl+Shift+Grave, Shift+5` | Copy selection to slot 5 |
| `Ctrl+Shift+Grave, Shift+6` | Copy selection to slot 6 |
| `Ctrl+Shift+Grave, Shift+7` | Copy selection to slot 7 |
| `Ctrl+Shift+Grave, Shift+8` | Copy selection to slot 8 |
| `Ctrl+Shift+Grave, Shift+9` | Copy selection to slot 9 |

You must have text selected. QUILL announces the slot number and a text
preview: "Copied to slot 2".

### Management

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `Ctrl+Shift+Grave, X` | Open Copy Tray dialog |

All bindings are reassignable in `Tools > Customize & Support > Keyboard Manager` or the Command
Palette.

## Using the Edit Menu

All commands are available in `Edit > Copy Tray`. The submenu contains:

- `Copy to Slot 1` through `Copy to Slot 9` — copy the current selection
- `Paste from Slot 1` through `Paste from Slot 9` — paste at the cursor
- `Open Copy Tray...` — open the management dialog
- `Clear All Tray Slots` — clear all slots after confirmation

## Using the System Tray Icon

Right-click the QUILL icon in the system notification area (bottom-right
taskbar area). The context menu includes a **Copy Tray** submenu that lists
every occupied slot with its label (if any) and a text preview. Clicking a slot
pastes its content into the currently active QUILL document. This lets you
paste from the tray without bringing the main window to the front.

## Using the Dialog

Open the dialog with `Ctrl+Shift+Grave, X`, `Edit > Copy Tray > Open Copy
Tray`, or the Command Palette (`edit.open_copy_tray`). The dialog shows all
nine slots in a list. Each row displays:

- The slot number
- An optional label
- A preview of the stored text (empty slots show `(empty)`)

Navigate the list with the arrow keys. The following buttons appear below the
list:

- **Paste** (Enter or double-click) — paste the selected slot's text at the
  cursor position and close the dialog. Disabled when the selected slot is
  empty.
- **Copy Selection Here** — copy the current editor selection into the selected
  slot and refresh the list. Disabled when no text is selected in the editor.
- **Set Label...** — open a text-entry prompt to name the selected slot. Labels
  appear in all slot listings and in screen-reader announcements.
- **Clear Slot** — empty the selected slot. Disabled when already empty.
- **Close** (Escape) — close the dialog without pasting.

## Labelling Slots

Slot labels are optional but recommended for any slot you use regularly. A
label makes the slot identifiable in the dialog and in every spoken
announcement. Labelling slot 1 "signature" means you will hear "Pasted from
slot 1 (signature)" instead of "Pasted from slot 1".

To set a label:

1. Open the Copy Tray dialog.
2. Select the slot you want to label.
3. Press `Set Label...`.
4. Type the label and press Enter.

Labels are persisted alongside slot text and survive restarts.

## Accessibility Notes

- Every Copy Tray operation announces its result through QUILL's screen-reader
  interface. Copy, paste, clear, and label operations all produce spoken
  feedback.
- The slot list in the dialog receives initial focus when the dialog opens.
- Slot labels, when set, are included in every announcement.
- Empty slots are clearly identified as `(empty)` in all contexts.
- The `Clear All Tray Slots` confirmation dialog defaults to No to prevent
  accidental data loss.
- The `Ctrl+Shift+N` paste scheme is designed for screen reader users: one
  familiar chord activates slot N instantly, no menu navigation required.

## Tips

- **Research accumulator.** Assign each tray slot to a document section. Copy
  a relevant excerpt to each slot as you read through a source, then paste
  them in order when drafting.
- **Code boilerplate.** Keep import blocks, standard headers, and closing
  patterns in labelled slots for one-chord insertion.
- **Cross-document paste.** Copy a phrase to a tray slot, switch documents,
  paste from the tray — the system clipboard is untouched.
- **Persistent library.** Slots survive restarts. Build a set of standard
  fragments you reach for daily.
- **System tray access.** Paste into any QUILL document directly from the
  notification-area icon without bringing the window to the front.

# Appendix: Copy Tray design notes

_Folded in from the former docs/copy_tray_notes.md on 2026-06-13._

# Copy Tray: What Was Built and How It Feels

## What Was Built

Copy Tray is a nine-slot persistent clipboard integrated across QUILL's menu
bar, keyboard layer, dialog system, and system tray icon. Every slot holds text
that survives application restarts.

### Core model (`quill/core/copy_tray.py`)

A pure Python model with no wx dependency. `CopyTray` owns nine `TraySlot`
instances. Each slot has `text`, `label`, and `copied_at`. The model reads and
writes `copy_tray.json` in the QUILL data directory using `write_json_atomic`
(temp file + `os.replace`). A corrupt file causes a silent fresh start; it
never raises to the UI.

### UI mixin (`quill/ui/main_frame_copy_tray.py`)

`CopyTrayMixin` is mixed into `MainFrame`. Methods:

- `copy_to_tray_slot(n)` — copies the editor selection to slot n; announces
  slot number and text preview.
- `paste_from_tray_slot(n)` — inserts slot n text at cursor (or replaces
  selection); announces slot number and label.
- `open_copy_tray()` — opens the management dialog; pastes if the user chooses
  Paste and returns to the editor.
- `clear_all_tray_slots()` — Yes/No confirmation (default No); clears all nine
  slots on Yes.

### Dialog (`quill/ui/copy_tray_dialog.py`)

A resizable wx.Dialog with a ListBox and five action buttons. Each list row
shows slot number, optional label, and a 60-character preview. The list
receives focus on open. Buttons: Paste (Enter), Copy Selection Here, Set
Label..., Clear Slot, Close (Escape). Double-click pastes. Button states
update on every selection change: Paste and Clear Slot are disabled on empty
slots; Copy Selection Here is disabled when no editor text is selected.

### Keyboard bindings (`quill/core/keymap.py`)

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `Ctrl+Shift+1` through `Ctrl+Shift+9` | Paste from slot 1-9 |
| `Ctrl+Shift+Grave, Shift+1` through `Ctrl+Shift+Grave, Shift+9` | Copy selection to slot 1-9 |
| `Ctrl+Shift+Grave, X` | Open Copy Tray dialog |

The paste bindings use the number row with `Ctrl+Shift`. These keys were
confirmed free across the entire QUILL keymap. QUILL-key bare digits 1-6 are
heading shortcuts; adding Shift produces a distinct chord with no conflict.

All 20 commands (`edit.open_copy_tray`, `edit.clear_all_tray_slots`,
`edit.copy_to_tray_1..9`, `edit.paste_from_tray_1..9`) are registered in
the keymap and appear in the Command Palette. All are reassignable in the
Keymap Editor.

### Menu integration (`quill/ui/main_frame_menu.py`)

`Edit > Copy Tray` submenu with:
- Copy to Slot 1-9
- Paste from Slot 1-9
- Open Copy Tray...
- Clear All Tray Slots

The 18 per-slot items use dedicated `wx.NewIdRef()` IDs (`_id_copy_tray_slots`
and `_id_paste_tray_slots` arrays). Management commands are recirculated from
the power tools manifest via `_append_power_tools_copy_tray_items`.

### Power tools manifest (`quill/ui/main_frame_power_tools_menu.py`)

New `"copy_tray"` group with `edit.open_copy_tray` and
`edit.clear_all_tray_slots`. New recirculation helper
`_append_power_tools_copy_tray_items`. The 18 individual slot commands are also
registered in the manifest for Command Palette discoverability.

### System tray integration (`quill/ui/main_frame.py`)

The `_on_tray_right_click` method now builds a **Copy Tray** submenu listing
every occupied slot with its label (if any) and a 50-character text preview.
Clicking a slot calls `_tray_paste_slot(n)`, which restores the main window if
it is hidden, then pastes the slot content. If all slots are empty, the submenu
shows "(all slots empty)" as a disabled item. "Open Copy Tray..." is always
present at the bottom of the submenu.

## The User Experience

### First encounter

You open QUILL to write a long document while researching from several other
sources. You read a quote you want to use, select it, and press
`Ctrl+Shift+Grave, Shift+1`. QUILL says "Copied to slot 1". You read another
fragment. `Ctrl+Shift+Grave, Shift+2`. "Copied to slot 2". A third. Slot 3.

You switch to your draft. Where you want the first quote, press `Ctrl+Shift+1`.
QUILL says "Pasted from slot 1" and the text is there. The system clipboard was
never disturbed. The other two quotes are still in their slots.

You close QUILL. Come back tomorrow. Slots 1, 2, and 3 still hold their
contents.

### Using labels

After a few days you decide to give slot 1 a permanent home: your email
signature. You open `Ctrl+Shift+Grave, X`, navigate to slot 1, press Set
Label..., type "signature", press Enter. Now when you paste, QUILL says "Pasted
from slot 1 (signature)". The slot is identifiable without looking at a screen.

### From the system tray

QUILL is minimized to the system tray while you read in another browser. You
right-click the QUILL icon. The menu shows:

```
Show Quill
Copy Tray  >
  1.  signature — Hi, I wanted to follow up...
  2.  Hello world...
  3.  import sys, os, pathlib...
  ...
  Open Copy Tray...
Sticky Notes...
Exit Quill
```

You click slot 3. QUILL restores its window and pastes the import block at
your cursor. You minimize again.

### Screen reader workflow

Press `Ctrl+Shift+5`. QUILL says "Slot 5 is empty." You know immediately
without opening a dialog or reading the screen. Select some text, press
`Ctrl+Shift+Grave, Shift+5`. "Copied to slot 5." Move elsewhere. Press
`Ctrl+Shift+5`. "Pasted from slot 5." Everything happened through voice, at
typing speed, with standard modifier+number chords.

## Future Directions: Double-Tap and Beyond

The user asked whether pressing a key twice quickly could trigger an alternative
action. For Copy Tray, the natural double-tap behaviour would be:

- **Single `Ctrl+Shift+N`** — paste from slot N immediately.
- **Double `Ctrl+Shift+N`** (two presses within ~300ms) — peek: QUILL speaks
  what is in slot N *without pasting* ("Slot 3: Hello world..."). This lets
  a screen-reader user verify a slot's content before committing to paste.

Implementing double-tap detection requires a timer in the QUILL-key prefix
state machine, a 300ms debounce, and a clear screen-reader announcement
pattern. It is architecturally clean and would make the Copy Tray even more
efficient for screen-reader-only workflows. This is noted here as a planned
enhancement, not yet implemented.

Other places in QUILL where double-tap patterns could add value:

- **Double QUILL key** (two presses of `Ctrl+Shift+Grave`) = open Copy Tray
  dialog, similar to how Windows `Win+V` opens clipboard history.
- **Double `F3`** = repeat the last Find All and jump to the next cluster of
  matches.
- **Double `Ctrl+Z`** = undo back to the last explicit save point.
- **Double `Ctrl+G`** = return to the previous location (ping-pong navigation).
- **Double `Escape`** = collapse all side panels and return focus to the editor.

These should be evaluated selectively — double-tap timing is sensitive and can
interfere with rapid typists. The patterns with the clearest benefit and the
lowest collision risk are: Copy Tray peek and QUILL-key-double-press for the
tray dialog.

## Acknowledgments

QUILL's accessibility design draws on the work of earlier screen-reader-first
editors. In particular, the keyboard-first compare workflow and the F8 anchor
selection model were inspired by the approaches pioneered in EdSharp and Boxer.
We are grateful to those projects and their authors for showing what
accessible, keyboard-driven editing can be.

## Glossary of QUILL Terms

This glossary defines the jargon used throughout the QUILL interface, menus, and documentation. Terms appear roughly in order of how often you will encounter them as a new user.

**Abbreviation**
A short trigger word or phrase that QUILL automatically expands into longer text as you type. For example, typing `brb` could expand to "be right back". Abbreviations are managed in the Abbreviation Manager (`Ctrl+Shift+Grave, Shift+A`). Unlike snippets, abbreviations expand automatically without a separate insertion step and do not support interactive placeholders.

**Agent / Agent Center**
An AI-assisted workflow that generates a multi-step task plan based on a goal you describe. The Agent Center shows you each step before it runs so you can review and approve. Agents build on the Writing Assistant and Prompt Studio infrastructure and require an AI provider to be configured.

**Browse Mode / Quick Nav Mode**
A temporary navigation state that makes the QUILL key prefix commands available one at a time. Press `Ctrl+Shift+Grave` once to arm Quick Nav for the next key you press. Press it twice to lock Browse Mode on until you press Escape. In Browse Mode, letter keys and arrow keys invoke navigation commands rather than inserting characters, similar to the virtual cursor mode in screen readers.

**Command Palette**
A searchable pop-up listing every registered QUILL command with its current keyboard shortcut. Open with `Ctrl+Shift+P`. Type any part of a command name to filter the list, then press Enter to run it. The fastest way to reach any action without memorising menu paths or key bindings.

**Copy Tray**
A multi-slot clipboard within QUILL that holds up to twelve named text snippets at once. Unlike the Windows clipboard (which holds only one item), the Copy Tray lets you copy different pieces of text to individual numbered slots (`Ctrl+Shift+Grave, Shift+1` through `Shift+9`, `Shift+0`, `Shift+-`, `Shift+=`) and paste from any slot. Open the Copy Tray dialog with `Ctrl+Shift+Grave, X` or `Win+V`-style double QUILL-key press.

**Document Tab**
A single open file or generated artifact inside the QUILL editor area. QUILL is a tabbed editor; each file, compare summary, GLOW report, or AI output opens as its own document tab. Tabs are announced by name when you switch between them (`Ctrl+Tab`).

**GLOW (Guided Layout and Output Workflow)**
QUILL's built-in text quality review system. GLOW audits a document for structural issues (heading hierarchy, list consistency, spacing, encoding artefacts) and offers deterministic fixes. Audit results open as readable QUILL tabs; fixing the document opens a named preview and starts a compare session. GLOW focuses on plain text, Markdown, and HTML.

**Keymap / Keyboard Pack (.kqp)**
The mapping of keyboard shortcuts to QUILL commands. The keymap is fully editable in **Preferences → Keyboard**. You can export your keymap as a `.kqp` file (Keyboard Pack) to share it with others or import one provided by the community. Resetting the keymap restores factory defaults without affecting other preferences.

**Macro**
A recorded sequence of QUILL actions that you can replay on demand. Record a macro from **Tools → Macros → Start Recording**, perform the steps you want to automate, then stop recording. Play it back later to repeat the sequence exactly. Macros are ideal for repetitive cleanup tasks.

**Profile (Feature Profile)**
A named set of feature flags that controls which QUILL capabilities are visible and enabled. QUILL ships with profiles such as Writing, Developer, and Accessibility. Profiles hide features not relevant to a particular workflow, keeping menus and option dialogs focused. Switch profiles or edit them in **Preferences → Profiles and Features**.

**Prompt Studio**
A built-in tool for creating and saving reusable AI prompt templates with named input variables. A Prompt Studio template might be "Rewrite for Plain Language: ${input:text}" — you fill in the variable each time you run the prompt. Prompts are stored as `.pqp` files and can be imported and exported.

**Quillin (Extension)**
A sandboxed plug-in for QUILL, also called an extension. Quillins can add new commands, menu items, custom AI prompts, or automation scripts. Each Quillin has a `manifest.json` that describes its capabilities. QUILL ships with several bundled Quillins (word count, AI writing prompts) and supports user-installed ones. The Quillin Manager is in **Preferences → Extensions**.

**Recovery / Session Recovery**
QUILL silently auto-saves your work at intervals. If QUILL closes unexpectedly (crash, power loss, accidental close), it detects the unsaved state on next launch and offers to restore the last known version. Recovery files are stored separately from your saved files so a corrupted recovery never overwrites your original. Manage recovery in **File → Recover Document**.

**Remote Site**
A connection configuration for a server QUILL can connect to directly to open and save files. Supported protocols are FTP, SFTP, HTTPS (WebDAV), and S3-compatible object storage. Sites are named and saved in **File → Remote Sites → Manage Remote Sites** so you do not have to re-enter credentials each time. Each site stores host, port, protocol, credentials (encrypted on Windows via DPAPI), and a default path.

**Safe Mode**
A startup mode that disables AI, Watch Folder, and Quillin extensions. Useful when a Quillin or AI provider is causing problems and you need a clean environment. Launch with `--safe-mode` on the command line or set `QUILL_SAFE_MODE=1` in the environment. In Safe Mode, a status bar indicator tells you which features are disabled.

**Session (AI Session)**
A persistent conversation thread between you and an AI provider inside QUILL. Sessions have a name, a provider, a model, and a message history. You can have multiple named sessions and switch between them. Sessions are stored locally and can be exported. The Writing Assistant always runs inside a session.

**Skill / Skill Library**
A named, reusable AI workflow defined as a series of steps (prompts, transforms, and conditions). Skills are more structured than single prompts: each step in the skill can feed its output into the next. The Skill Library (`Tools → AI → Skill Library`) lets you browse, run, and author skills. Skills are stored as `.json` files.

**Snippet**
A reusable block of text with optional interactive placeholders that you insert manually at the cursor position. Snippets support variables such as `${input:name}` (a prompted text field), `${choice:a|b}` (a pick-list), `${date}`, `${time}`, and `${cursor}` (where the cursor lands after insertion). Insert with `Ctrl+Shift+Grave, S`; manage with `Ctrl+Shift+Grave, Shift+S`. Compare with abbreviations, which expand automatically.

**Sound Pack**
A collection of audio files that QUILL uses for non-speech feedback: key sounds, navigation tones, alert chimes, and (optionally) indentation-level tones for coding. Sound Packs are loaded from a named directory and can be swapped in Preferences. The default pack uses synthesised bell tones; custom packs can use any WAV files following the naming convention.

**Template**
A pre-written document structure that you can use as a starting point for new files. Templates are plain text or Markdown files stored in a designated folder. Opening a template creates a new untitled document pre-filled with the template content. Manage templates in **File → New from Template**.

**Watch Folder**
A directory that QUILL monitors in the background. Any supported file dropped into the watch folder is automatically opened as a new document tab (or processed according to per-folder rules). Useful for transcription pipelines, dictation outputs, and batch review workflows. Configure in **Tools → Watch Folder**.

**WebView / Side Preview**
The rendered HTML preview pane that appears alongside the editor when you press `F6` (or enable it via **View → Side Preview**). The preview is powered by Microsoft Edge WebView2 and renders Markdown, HTML, and plain text in real time as you type. The preview is read-only and does not affect the document.

**Welcome Guide**
A lightweight, profile-aware getting-started document that opens inside QUILL as a document tab. Unlike the full User Guide (which opens in your browser), the Welcome Guide adapts its content to show only the features enabled in your current profile. Open it from **Help → Open Welcome Guide**.

**Writing Assistant**
QUILL's AI writing panel. The Writing Assistant accepts a goal described in plain language and ranks relevant QUILL commands, offers preset rewrite/summarize/continue/grammar flows, and can execute a sandboxed Python transform against the current document. It runs inside an AI Session and requires an AI provider to be configured in Preferences.

**QUILL Key**
The keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+Shift+Grave` (the backtick/grave key above Tab). Pressing it once arms a one-shot prefix; pressing it twice locks Quick Nav Mode on. The QUILL key is the entry point to most of QUILL's power features. Every chord is announced when pressed and is remappable in **Preferences → Keyboard**.
