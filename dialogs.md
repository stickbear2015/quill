# QUILL dialog regression checklist

This is the master manual regression checklist for every user-facing dialog in
QUILL. Use it to verify that each dialog opens, is fully keyboard and
screen-reader operable, has a working Escape and an explicit default, and
returns focus to the editor on close.

How to use this file:

- Work through a section, open each dialog with the listed keyboard command (or
  menu path when there is no default key), and confirm it behaves.
- Tick the checkbox when a dialog passes a full pass on the current build.
- When a dialog fails, leave it unticked and file or reference an issue next to
  it.
- Keep this file up to date: whenever a dialog is added, removed, or rebound,
  update the matching row in the same change. See the contributor rule in
  `.github/copilot-instructions.md` ("Keep dialogs.md current").

This manual checklist is the human companion to the machine-enforced dialog
registry. The authoritative, source-of-truth inventory of every dialog *surface*
is generated from code by `quill/tools/dialog_inventory.py` and committed as
`tests/unit/ui/fixtures/dialog_inventory.json`; the A11Y-4 banned-pattern gate
and `tests/unit/ui/test_dialog_inventory.py` fail the build if any dialog is
unregistered, unclassified, or on a bespoke surface. Regenerate the snapshot with
`python -m quill.tools.dialog_inventory --write` whenever you add, move, or
remove a dialog. See "Dialog Excellence Mandates" in the copilot instructions.

What "passes" means for every dialog (the A11Y-4 contract):

1. It opens from the listed command or menu path.
2. Tab and Shift+Tab reach every control in a sensible order.
3. A screen reader announces the dialog title and each control.
4. Enter activates the default action; Escape (and the close button) cancels.
5. On close, focus returns to the editor.
6. The dialog does not trap, freeze, or go silent.

Automated companion tests and the manual QA plan:

- **Announcement and SR detection tests** — `tests/accessibility/test_accessibility_suite.py`
  and `tests/accessibility/test_announcement_grammar.py` cover screen-reader announcement
  capture, SR detection, and announcement grammar. Run with `pytest tests/accessibility/ -q`.
- **Manual QA procedure** — `docs/qa/final-qa-test-plan.md` §6 ("Dialog estate pass")
  describes the full human-executed pass against this checklist, including the SR coverage
  matrix (NVDA full, JAWS spot, Narrator sanity) and the A11Y-4 sign-off criteria.

Legend: "QUILL key" is the prefix chord, default `Ctrl+Shift+Grave` (backtick).
"via menu" means there is no default keybinding; reach it through the named menu
or the command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`).

## W. Power Tools and recirculated editor conveniences

Editor power-tool conveniences (EDS-1..20). These commands carry no default
keybinding; reach each from its conventional menu home (or the command palette,
`Ctrl+Shift+P`). As of the menu reorg (menus.md §3.7) these commands were
recirculated out of the former power-tools monolith into their natural
menus; the cohesive editor-behavior remainder lives under **Tools > Power
Tools**. Only the commands that present a dialog are listed here; the remaining
power-tool commands act directly on the document and announce their result.

- [ ] Insert Special Character (codepoint prompt): Insert > Insert Special Character
- [ ] Insert Calculated Date: Insert > Insert Calculated Date
- [ ] Insert File Content (file picker): Insert > Insert File Content
- [ ] Number Lines (start prompt): Format > Transform Lines > Number Lines
- [ ] Hard-Wrap Lines (width prompt): Format > Transform Lines > Hard-Wrap Lines
- [ ] Count Matches (regex prompt): Search > Count Matches
- [ ] Extract Matches (regex prompt): Search > Extract Matches
- [ ] Go to Percent (percentage prompt): Navigate > Go to Percent
- [ ] Infer Indentation (adopt-unit confirm): Tools > Power Tools > Infer Indentation
- [ ] Rename Current File (name prompt): File > Rename Current File
- [ ] Delete Current File (delete confirm): File > Delete Current File

## X. Notebook (Workspace) dialogs

Multi-document workspace commands (§10.4 Milestone 2). All custom surfaces are
`hardened_custom` per the dialog contract.

- [ ] New Notebook (name prompt + file-save picker): File > Notebook > New Notebook
- [ ] New Notebook from Folder (folder picker + name prompt + file-save picker):
  File > Notebook > New from Folder
- [ ] Open Notebook (file-open picker filtered to `.quillnotebook`):
  File > Notebook > Open Notebook
- [ ] Save Snapshot (name prompt): File > Notebook > Save Snapshot
- [ ] Manage Snapshots (list with Rename / Delete buttons): `hardened_custom`
  (wires `apply_modal_ids`): File > Notebook > Manage Snapshots
- [ ] Go to Entry in Notebook (tree navigator — `_show_tree_navigator`):
  Navigate > Go to Entry in Notebook
- [ ] Go to Heading in Notebook (tree navigator — `_show_tree_navigator`):
  Navigate > Go to Heading in Notebook

## Y. Startup-only dialogs

These appear only during a specific startup condition. Test by reproducing the
trigger.

- [ ] Crash Recovery (after an unclean exit)
- [ ] Untrusted Location Warning (opening a file from an untrusted folder)
- [ ] Safe Mode banner / status-bar indicator (when `QUILL_SAFE_MODE=1` is set
  on the environment, or `quill --safe-mode` is passed): the status bar shows
  "Safe Mode — plugins, AI, and network disabled" and a one-shot announcement
  fires on first show. Verified manually by setting the env var before launch
  and confirming the AI / assistant surfaces and watch-folder network calls
  short-circuit per `quill/stability/safe_mode.py`. Cross-reference: the
  pre-release review's N-10 / H-SAFE-1 fixes.

## Maintenance note

This checklist was generated from a full source scrub of `quill/ui/` (chiefly
`quill/ui/main_frame.py`, plus `palette.py`, `assistant_panel.py`,
`assistant_tools.py`, `ai_model_panel.py`, `style_panel.py`, `sticky_notes.py`,
`preview_dialog.py`, and `web_form.py`) and the bindings in
`quill/core/keymap.py`. When you add or change a dialog, update the matching row
here in the same change so this file stays a faithful, complete map.

## Cross-references

- **Safe Mode** — see `quill/stability/safe_mode.py` (env-var contract is
  `QUILL_SAFE_MODE=1`) and `quill/stability/__init__.py` (`SafeModeConfig`,
  `build_safe_mode_config`). When safe mode is active, the AI assistant
  surfaces in section Q, the BITS / Whisperer surfaces in section R, the
  watch-folder network calls in section M, and the Agent Center all
  short-circuit. Manual verification: launch with `set QUILL_SAFE_MODE=1`
  (cmd) / `$env:QUILL_SAFE_MODE=1` (PowerShell) / `--safe-mode` (CLI flag);
  confirm the status-bar banner and the AI/assistant menu items are
  disabled.
