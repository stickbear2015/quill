# Codex Handoff

## 2026-06-14 16:21:11 -04:00 Broader Merge-Sensitive Verification

- ran a broader merge-sensitive suite across the `main` shell surfaces that publishing extends:
  - `main_frame`
  - file/menu wiring
  - remote-sites coexistence
  - dialog governance
  - feature wiring
  - network and module-budget gates
- intent of this pass was to validate our publishing integration against current `main`, not to re-own unrelated `main` feature behavior

## 2026-06-14 16:21:11 -04:00 Latest Verification

- broader publishing-integration verification passed
- result: `424 passed in 36.44s`
- run detail:
  - used workspace-local temp path:
    - `--basetemp=.tmp/pytest-publishing-broader`

## 2026-06-14 16:21:11 -04:00 Publishing Verification + CLAUDE Cleanup

- restored `CLAUDE.md` to match `main` so the accessibility-heading guidance lives only in local `AGENTS.md`
- reran the publishing-owned verification slice against the merged branch state rather than the unrelated broader `main` additions
- confirmed the integrated publishing code still passes with current `main`

## 2026-06-14 16:21:11 -04:00 Latest Verification

- focused publishing-owned plus governance verification passed
- result: `121 passed in 43.18s`
- verification set:
  - `tests/unit/core/test_features.py`
  - `tests/unit/core/test_publishing.py`
  - `tests/unit/core/test_publishing_browse.py`

  - used workspace-local temp path:
    - `--basetemp=.tmp/pytest-publishing-final`

## 2026-06-12 19:10:42 -04:00 Clean Handoff State

- branch is being left in a clean documented stopping state for push
- latest pass in this checkpoint is documentation-only
- no additional product code changed after the last publishing implementation and startup-regression fix commit

Current practical state:

- publishing branch includes:
  - browse/open remote content
  - update remote content
  - create post draft
  - create page draft
- merged-main startup regression has been repaired and documented
- planning now explicitly covers the next likely product/design work:
  - browse scaling and timeout handling
  - draft visibility in browse
  - stronger publishing confirmation and result feedback
  - remote item title/tab identity

Push expectation from this checkpoint:

- commit the current documentation and planning updates
- push so the remote branch reflects the same clean stop state

## 2026-06-12 19:05:06 -04:00 Documentation Language Correction

- corrected the latest planning-note wording so it does not frame Quill as being only for blind users
- current intended framing remains:
  - accessibility-first
  - strong non-visual feedback
  - provider-neutral publishing design
  - broader user audience than a single accessibility group
- no product code or behavior changed in this documentation pass

## 2026-06-12 18:42:20 -04:00 Startup Regression Fix

- fixed a launch-blocking startup regression introduced by the merged upstream menu split
- failure was:
  - missing `MainFrame._append_power_tools_file_create_items`
- this was an upstream/main integration bug, not a publishing-slice regression
- resolution:
  - added the missing helper to `PowerToolsMenuMixin`
  - added a regression test so menu-builder helper calls cannot drift from mixin definitions again

## 2026-06-12 18:42:20 -04:00 Latest Verification

- targeted startup-regression plus publishing-owned verification passed
- result: `40 passed in 1.85s`
- verification set:
  - `tests/unit/ui/test_main_frame_menu_contract.py`
  - `tests/unit/core/test_publishing_browse.py`
  - `tests/unit/core/test_publishing_framework.py`
  - `tests/unit/ui/test_main_frame.py`
  - `tests/unit/ui/test_publishing_connection_dialog_a11y.py`

## 2026-06-12 18:31:56 -04:00 Latest Coding Update

- completed the first local-to-remote publish/create slice
- Quill now supports:
  - `Create Post Draft...`
  - `Create Page Draft...`
- both actions are available under `File > Publish`
- both actions are command-registered publishing commands, so they stay compatible with command-palette discovery and feature gating
- successful create flows now attach publishing-remote metadata to the current tab so later `Update Remote Content...` can target the created remote item

## 2026-06-12 18:31:56 -04:00 Latest Verification

- publishing-owned create/update/browse slice passed
- result: `39 passed in 1.94s`
- verification set:
  - `tests/unit/core/test_publishing_browse.py`
  - `tests/unit/core/test_publishing_framework.py`
  - `tests/unit/ui/test_main_frame.py`
  - `tests/unit/ui/test_main_frame_menu_contract.py`
  - `tests/unit/ui/test_publishing_connection_dialog_a11y.py`

## 2026-06-12 18:31:56 -04:00 Next Read

- branch now covers:
  - connection storage and verification
  - browse/open remote publishing content
  - update existing remote content
  - create new remote post/page drafts from local documents
- likely next meaningful slice is the first non-draft publish-state step:
  - publish current draft/item
  - or a tighter “promote created draft” flow if we want to keep scope small
- no new governed custom dialog was added in the draft-create slice; the flow still relies on review-first confirmation prompts only

## 2026-06-12 18:15:44 -04:00 Latest Coding Update

- completed the planned publishing `Update Remote Content...` slice
- Quill can now update an opened publishing-remote post or page back to the provider through:
  - `File > Publish > Update Remote Content...`
- the update flow is explicit and review-first
- the flow now respects the saved authoring surface from the open step:
  - Markdown-authored remote tabs render to HTML body content on send
  - explicitly HTML-authored remote tabs send raw HTML unchanged
- successful update responses now refresh remote metadata on the current document:
  - status
  - updated timestamp
  - remote URL

## 2026-06-12 18:15:44 -04:00 Latest Verification

- publishing-owned update slice passed after implementation
- result: `36 passed in 1.58s`
- verification set:
  - `tests/unit/core/test_publishing_browse.py`
  - `tests/unit/core/test_publishing_framework.py`
  - `tests/unit/ui/test_main_frame.py`
  - `tests/unit/ui/test_main_frame_menu_contract.py`
  - `tests/unit/ui/test_publishing_connection_dialog_a11y.py`

## 2026-06-12 18:15:44 -04:00 Next Read

- branch is ready for the next publishing slice after remote-update behavior
- likely next work should focus on the remaining publish/create path rather than more remote-open representation work
- before committing, keep in mind there is still local assistant-guidance noise in the workspace:
  - untracked `AGENTS.md`
  - modified `CLAUDE.md`
  These should stay out of the branch unless the user explicitly wants them tracked.

## 2026-06-12 17:30:59 -04:00 Clean Stop State

- removed leftover local temp/cache noise after the upstream resync audit
- corrected the mistaken repo-local guidance-file drift:
  - no repo `AGENTS.md`
  - no repo-local accessibility override left in `CLAUDE.md`
- no product behavior changed in this cleanup pass

Current practical state:

- publishing branch is synced with upstream and already pushed
- publishing integration remains healthy against current `main`
- workspace temp/cache noise has been cleared
- remaining tracked work from this pass is documentation-only

## 2026-06-12 17:27:38 -04:00 Current Merge State

- local `main` has been resynced to current `origin/main`
- synced `main` has been pushed to `fork/main`
- publishing branch has been updated with the latest upstream changes as of `97d04f6`

Current integration read:

- publishing still fits cleanly on top of new upstream shell changes
- new GitHub Remote work lives under `File > Open from Remote`
- publishing remains separate under `File > Publish`
- dialog inventory and MainFrame public-surface snapshots have been regenerated from merged source
- module-size budgets have been refreshed to acknowledge the integrated publishing branch state

## 2026-06-12 17:27:38 -04:00 Latest Verification

- maintained publishing plus merge-sensitive slice passed against the new upstream baseline
- result: `129 passed in 19.12s`

## 2026-06-12 17:27:38 -04:00 Next Read

- branch is current with upstream again
- publishing foundation still looks healthy after the sync
- next product slice remains the explicit `Update Remote Content...` workflow unless product direction changes

## 2026-06-10 23:09:01 -04:00 Final Stop State

- this branch is being left in a documentation-synced stopping state
- handoff, review log, and memory note have all been refreshed together
- no product-code changes were made in this final pass
- expected final action after this handoff update:
  - commit doc updates
  - push branch so nothing remains pending afterward

Current practical state:

- branch: `features/publishing-providers-framework`
- publishing foundation remains merged with current `origin/main`
- maintained publishing/merge-sensitive validation remains last known green at `87 passed in 9.85s`
- Codex support artifacts now live under `codex-notes/`

## 2026-06-10 23:03:19 -04:00 Codex Notes Home

- Codex support artifacts have now been centralized under `codex-notes/`
- current canonical locations:
  - handoff: `codex-notes/handoff/codex-handoff.md`
  - review log: `codex-notes/logs/codex-review-log.md`
  - branch memory: `codex-notes/memory/`
  - planning docs: `codex-notes/plans/`
  - one-off notes: `codex-notes/notes/`
- this was a housekeeping-only pass; no product behavior changed

## 2026-06-10 22:56:23 -04:00 Repo Organization

- next immediate work is repo housekeeping, not product code
- user requested:
  - commit the current readiness-assessment note/log state first
  - then consolidate planning/log/handoff/note artifacts into a central folder
- expected follow-up after this checkpoint:
  - centralize Codex process docs under one top-level location
  - update any references that still assume root-level note files
  - record the moves in the review log and handoff

## 2026-06-10 22:48:16 -04:00 Merge Readiness

- assessed whether the publishing branch should be merged to `main` now
- created:
  - `publishing-main-merge-readiness-note-2026-06-10.md`
- current recommendation is to hold off on a direct merge

Reasoning summary:

- the implemented publishing slice is stable and reviewable
- the full end-to-end publishing workflow is still incomplete
- `main` has recently been moving quickly in nearby UI architecture:
  - remote I/O
  - menu consolidation
  - notebook workspace
  - Node runtime / Quillins packaging
- this branch also contains branch-process documentation that should likely be reviewed before any full merge to `main`

Practical recommendation:

- okay to open or maintain a draft PR for visibility
- better to finish `Update Remote Content...` and do a cleanup/scoping pass before asking for final merge

## 2026-06-10 22:27:23 -04:00 Merge + Audit

- merged current `origin/main` into `features/publishing-providers-framework`
- resolved integration conflicts in:
  - `quill/ui/main_frame_menu.py`
  - `quill/tools/module_size_budgets.json`
  - `tests/unit/ui/fixtures/dialog_inventory.json`
- refreshed `tests/unit/ui/fixtures/main_frame_public_surface.json` for notebook public methods now present from merged `main`
- publishing branch behavior remains intact after merge:
  - remote publishing browse/open still defaults to `Readable Markdown`
  - per-open `Raw HTML` override still exists
  - explicit representation metadata still flows into the opened document state

## 2026-06-10 22:27:23 -04:00 Latest Verification

- reran the maintained branch-owned publishing plus merge-sensitive slice:
  - `tests/unit/core/test_publishing.py`
  - `tests/unit/core/test_publishing_browse.py`
  - `tests/unit/core/test_publishing_framework.py`
  - `tests/unit/core/test_features.py`
  - `tests/unit/core/test_remote_sites.py`
  - `tests/unit/ui/test_main_frame.py`
  - `tests/unit/ui/test_publishing_connection_dialog_a11y.py`
  - `tests/unit/ui/test_remote_sites_dialog.py`
  - `tests/unit/ui/test_main_frame_characterization.py`
  - `tests/unit/ui/test_main_frame_menu_contract.py`
  - `tests/unit/ui/test_dialog_inventory.py`
  - `tests/performance/test_budgets.py`
- result: `87 passed in 9.85s`

## 2026-06-10 22:27:23 -04:00 Recommended Next Slice

- branch is in a safe place to resume implementation
- next coding target remains `Update Remote Content...`
- suggested scope:
  - reuse stored publishing metadata from the current document
  - decide Markdown-to-HTML conversion versus raw-HTML send based on the saved authoring surface / representation
  - keep the flow aligned with merged remote-site and notebook-era menu/state conventions

## 2026-06-10 17:40:40 -04:00 Stopping Point

- branch is in a stable stopping state
- remote-open publishing representation work is committed and already pushed
- in-repo planning notes now include:
  - `main-branch-audit-note-2026-06-10.md`
  - `publishing-remote-integration-planning-2026-06-10.md`
- recommended next implementation slice when resuming:
  - `Update Remote Content...`
  - use the stored publishing authoring-surface metadata to decide Markdown-to-HTML conversion versus raw-HTML send path

## 2026-06-10 17:13:23 -04:00 Latest Coding Update

- completed the planned remote-open representation slice for publishing content
- browse/open now defaults to `Readable Markdown`
- browse/open now offers per-open `Raw HTML`
- added conservative fallback to `Raw HTML` for content Quill should not flatten misleadingly
- publishing-open metadata now records the chosen authoring surface from prepared content instead of hard-coded HTML assumptions

## 2026-06-10 17:13:23 -04:00 Latest Verification

- maintained publishing slice rerun after implementation:
  - `tests/unit/ui/test_main_frame_characterization.py`
  - `tests/unit/ui/test_dialog_inventory.py`
  - `tests/unit/ui/test_main_frame_menu_contract.py`
  - `tests/performance/test_budgets.py`
  - `tests/unit/core/test_publishing.py`
  - `tests/unit/core/test_publishing_browse.py`
  - `tests/unit/core/test_publishing_framework.py`
  - `tests/unit/core/test_features.py`
  - `tests/unit/ui/test_publishing_connection_dialog_a11y.py`
  - `tests/unit/ui/test_main_frame.py`
  - `tests/unit/core/test_remote_sites.py`
  - `tests/unit/ui/test_remote_sites_dialog.py`
- result: 87 passed in 9.96s

## 2026-06-10 16:19:03 -04:00 Maintainer Note

- main-branch findings from the reverted full-suite audit are preserved separately in:
  - `main-branch-audit-note-2026-06-10.md`
- branch work remains scoped to publishing after that note capture

## 2026-06-10 16:15:07 -04:00 Scope Correction

- reverted the out-of-scope audit-only changes from the mistaken full-suite pass
- reset verification back to the branch-owned publishing slice only

## 2026-06-10 16:15:07 -04:00 Current Verification

- reran the maintained publishing-focused slice:
  - `tests/unit/ui/test_main_frame_characterization.py`
  - `tests/unit/ui/test_dialog_inventory.py`
  - `tests/unit/ui/test_main_frame_menu_contract.py`
  - `tests/performance/test_budgets.py`
  - `tests/unit/core/test_publishing.py`
  - `tests/unit/core/test_publishing_browse.py`
  - `tests/unit/core/test_publishing_framework.py`
  - `tests/unit/core/test_features.py`
  - `tests/unit/ui/test_publishing_connection_dialog_a11y.py`
  - `tests/unit/ui/test_main_frame.py`
  - `tests/unit/core/test_remote_sites.py`
  - `tests/unit/ui/test_remote_sites_dialog.py`
- result: 84 passed in 9.75s

## 2026-06-10 15:57:07 -04:00 Audit Update

- ran a full `pytest -q` audit after the merged-`main` integration work
- fixed the stale test cluster that was still assuming pre-merge `QUILL_DATA_DIR` behavior
- added shared home-scoped test data setup in `tests/conftest.py`
- updated persistence/config test files to honor current `main`'s dev-only home-constrained data-dir contract
- tightened two suite hot spots:
  - `tests/unit/core/test_net_tls.py` now prefilters files before AST parsing
  - `quill/core/thesaurus.py` now avoids double synonym cleaning during thesaurus parse

## 2026-06-10 15:57:07 -04:00 Audit Verification

- focused repair slices now pass:
  - stale persistence/config failures: 11 passed
  - IPC/keymap/menu persistence verification: 11 passed
  - TLS audit verification: 5 passed
  - thesaurus reset-cache timeout repro: 1 passed in isolation
- full suite is improved but still not fully green in one uninterrupted run
- current blocking point:
  - `tests/unit/core/test_reset_caches.py::test_thesaurus_preload_after_reset_is_idempotent`
- current read:
  - isolated behavior is green
  - remaining problem appears to be suite-run timeout/performance pressure, not a confirmed publishing regression

## 2026-06-10 15:57:07 -04:00 Recommended Next Slice

- if the suite is stabilized fully green, next planned code work should still be remote-open representation handling:
  - open publishing remotes as `Readable Markdown` by default
  - allow `Raw HTML` override when needed
  - keep representation metadata explicit for follow-on save/update flows

## Latest Merge Update

- resynced local `main` with `origin/main` after upstream advanced by 4 commits
- pushed refreshed `main` to `fork/main`
- merged updated `main` into `features/publishing-providers-framework`
- upstream changes included a substantial new Remote Sites feature touching:
  - `quill/ui/main_frame.py`
  - `quill/ui/main_frame_menu.py`
  - dialog inventory/public-surface fixtures
  - network-egress audit
  - module-size budgets
- reapplied the branch's earlier publishing-audit tighten-ups on top of that merge:
  - explicit raw-HTML publishing-open metadata in `main_frame.py`
  - test fixes for the current dev-only `QUILL_DATA_DIR` contract
  - publishing checklist/readiness/plan updates
- resolved merge conflicts in:
  - `quill/tools/module_size_budgets.json`
  - `tests/unit/ui/fixtures/dialog_inventory.json`
  - `tests/unit/ui/fixtures/main_frame_public_surface.json`
- regenerated dialog/public-surface snapshots from merged source
- merge commit created: `47d5ff7` (`Merge main into features/publishing-providers-framework`)

## Latest Verification

- focused integrated test slice passed after the merge and reapply work:
  - `tests/unit/ui/test_main_frame_characterization.py`
  - `tests/unit/ui/test_dialog_inventory.py`
  - `tests/unit/ui/test_main_frame_menu_contract.py`
  - `tests/performance/test_budgets.py`
  - `tests/unit/core/test_publishing.py`
  - `tests/unit/core/test_publishing_browse.py`
  - `tests/unit/core/test_publishing_framework.py`
  - `tests/unit/core/test_features.py`
  - `tests/unit/ui/test_publishing_connection_dialog_a11y.py`
  - `tests/unit/ui/test_main_frame.py`
  - `tests/unit/core/test_remote_sites.py`
  - `tests/unit/ui/test_remote_sites_dialog.py`
- result: 84 passed

## Latest Audit Update

- performed a branch audit after merging current `main`
- confirmed the publishing branch still aligns with the approved architecture in these areas:
  - feature gating
  - `File > Publish` menu placement
  - dialog governance
  - explicit network-egress review
  - provider-aware core seam for WordPress browse/open
- confirmed the main remaining behavior gap versus the plan is remote-open representation:
  - current implementation opens remote content as raw HTML
  - approved next step is still `Readable Markdown` by default with a per-open `Raw HTML` override and conservative fallback
- tightened the current code to record explicit publishing-open metadata for the interim raw-HTML behavior
- updated `dialogs.md` and local readiness/planning notes to match the real post-merge state
- updated older publishing/feature tests so they honor the current `main` dev-only `QUILL_DATA_DIR` contract from `quill/core/paths.py`
- verified the focused audit slice after those updates: 53 tests passed

## Current State

- Branch: `features/publishing-providers-framework`
- Stage: planning plus implementation/audit alignment
- Coding status: code exists; next work should follow the updated plan and merged-main constraints
- Branch baseline: merged with `main` again on 2026-06-10 after syncing `fork/main` to `origin/main`

## Latest Planning Decisions

- remote content opens as `Readable Markdown` by default
- the open flow provides a per-open override to `Raw HTML`
- Quill automatically falls back to `Raw HTML` when conversion would be too lossy or structurally untrustworthy
- convert only clearly text-first HTML to `Readable Markdown`
- fall back to `Raw HTML` for anything interactive, embedded, layout-heavy, or structurally rich

## Next Likely Planning Step

- refine the fallback boundary into a more exact decision list
- define what metadata must be stored to remember the chosen authoring surface
- check whether the new Remote Sites shell patterns from `main` suggest any publishing-shell simplifications worth adopting before the next publish/update slice
- keep the design provider-neutral and accessibility-first

## Resume Instruction

When returning later, tell Codex:

`Check codex-handoff.md and codex-review-log.md first, then continue planning.`

## 2026-06-14 Main Merge Refresh

- merged the latest `origin/main` into `features/publishing-providers-framework` again, this time bringing in the close-fix follow-up and braille/mainline work from `d861abb` (`feat(braille): Phase 5 translation + docs; fix(#210): never trap the editor open`)
- resolved the merge by keeping upstream main behavior for:
  - braille feature/catalog/settings/statusbar wiring
  - `_on_close` hard-exit + crash-report recovery flow
  - consolidated docs/release notes
- re-applied only the publishing-owned pieces on top:
  - `future.publishing` feature definition/profile visibility
  - `File > Publish` menu and command surfaces
  - publishing remote metadata and provider-neutral flows
- regenerated:
  - `tests/unit/ui/fixtures/dialog_inventory.json`
  - `tests/unit/ui/fixtures/main_frame_public_surface.json`
- corrected the menu-contract test so it reads all `main_frame*.py` modules again, including the power-tools helper definitions that publishing still depends on
- confirmed `CLAUDE.md` matches `origin/main`

## 2026-06-14 Verification Refresh

  - `pytest -q --basetemp=.tmp\pytest-all-branch` stops during collection in `tests/unit/ui/test_update_manager.py` because upstream dependencies are missing (`requests`, then `platform_utils`)
  - after installing `requests`, `pytest -q --ignore tests/unit/ui/test_update_manager.py --basetemp=.tmp\pytest-all-minus-update-manager` still reveals upstream/mainline failures outside publishing ownership:
    - `tests/unit/core/ai/test_ai_sessions.py::test_list_and_most_recent`
    - `tests/unit/core/test_recovery.py::test_begin_session_offers_previous_unclean_snapshot`
    - `tests/unit/core/test_recovery.py::test_latest_session_snapshot_and_reader`
    - `tests/unit/core/test_recovery.py::test_concurrent_begin_session_serialize_via_lock`
    - later run timeout in `tests/unit/core/test_reset_caches.py::test_thesaurus_preload_after_reset_is_idempotent`
- conclusion: the publishing integration is green in the owned and merge-touching areas; the remaining full-suite blockers are upstream/environment issues, not introduced by the publishing branch work
