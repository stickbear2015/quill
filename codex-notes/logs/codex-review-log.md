# Codex Review Log

## 2026-06-12 19:10:42 -04:00

Stopping-point sync:

- user requested a clean handoff state, detailed commit, and push
- current branch work is being left in a documented planning-and-implementation checkpoint
- latest uncommitted changes in this pass are documentation-only:
  - updated publishing plan addendum
  - new focused planning note
  - corrected audience-language framing
  - refreshed readiness memory
  - refreshed handoff
  - refreshed review log

Branch state being documented at this stop:

- merged `main` publishing branch remains repaired after the upstream menu-split regression
- implemented publishing slices currently include:
  - connection storage and verification
  - browse/open remote content
  - remote update
  - create post/page draft
- planning artifacts now also capture the next design concerns:
  - browse scaling and timeouts
  - draft visibility
  - stronger publishing confirmation/result UX
  - remote-item editor identity

Push intent:

- commit only tracked repo artifacts relevant to this branch state
- keep local assistant-guidance files out of git

## 2026-06-12 19:05:06 -04:00

Documentation correction:

- user requested that the latest planning write-up not imply Quill is being built only for blind users
- corrected the new planning note accordingly
- updated related support docs to keep the wording consistent:
  - handoff
  - readiness memory
  - review log

Corrected framing:

- Quill remains accessibility-first
- the product should provide strong non-visual feedback
- the audience framing should stay broader than a single accessibility group

## 2026-06-12 19:00:31 -04:00

Research and planning pass:

- user requested a thorough planning-only pass with no coding
- reviewed current official WordPress developer documentation to inform provider-neutral publishing planning:
  - posts REST API reference
  - pages REST API reference
  - REST API pagination guidance

Key research findings used in planning:

- WordPress post/page collection endpoints default to `status=publish`
- post/page collection endpoints support explicit `status` filtering
- large result sets are expected to be paginated
- WordPress guidance explicitly expects clients to retrieve large collections page by page

Planning outputs completed:

- updated the main publishing planning document with a new addendum covering:
  - draft visibility
  - browse scaling / timeout handling
  - confirmation-result UX
  - remote-item editor identity
- created a separate review note for focused reading:
  - `codex-notes/notes/publishing-browse-confirmation-and-remote-identity-planning-2026-06-12.md`

Important guardrail preserved:

- research used WordPress because it is the first implemented provider
- planning conclusions were written to remain provider-neutral at the framework and product-contract level

## 2026-06-12 18:54:42 -04:00

Planning-only checkpoint:

- user reported product-behavior concerns after the recent publishing work
- requested planning only, not coding

Observed/product concerns to account for in the plan:

- drafts created through publishing are not visible in the current browse-content experience
- browsing both posts and pages together can time out on large servers
- create-draft actions do not currently provide a strong enough success confirmation for user confidence
- update/publish flows should similarly provide explicit confirmation and outcome feedback
- opened remote posts/pages currently do not get a temporary local file/title-bar path that reflects the remote item title

Planning implications recorded from this checkpoint:

- browse-content likely needs a more scalable loading strategy for large sites:
  - staged loading
  - per-kind loading
  - better timeout/error messaging
  - possibly separate post/page fetches surfaced progressively
- draft visibility needs to be reviewed as part of the browse contract, not treated as a side issue
- publishing actions need a clearer confirmation/result UX across:
  - create draft
  - update remote content
  - later publish/promote flows
- title-bar/document identity for opened publishing items should be reviewed so the open tab better reflects the remote content title

## 2026-06-12 18:45:31 -04:00

Post-fix assessment:

- user asked whether the startup regression was caused by merging `main` into the publishing branch
- answer: yes
- the failure source was the upstream/main menu-split integration state carried into the branch merge:
  - `MenuBuilderMixin` called `_append_power_tools_file_create_items(...)`
  - `PowerToolsMenuMixin` did not define that helper
  - startup failed during menu construction
- this was a merge-quality miss, not a publishing-feature regression

Process correction going forward:

- post-merge work needs an immediate launch/smoke pass, not only feature-slice tests
- upstream mixin/menu refactors need explicit contract checks:
  - builder call sites
  - helper definitions
  - startup-critical menu bindings
- the new regression test added in this fix is intended to keep this exact merge failure from recurring

## 2026-06-12 18:42:20 -04:00

Startup regression fix:

- fixed the reported launch crash:
  - `AttributeError: 'MainFrame' object has no attribute '_append_power_tools_file_create_items'`

Root cause:

- this was not caused by the post-merge publishing changes
- it was an upstream/main integration gap from the split menu/mixin refactor
- `MenuBuilderMixin._build_menu()` called `_append_power_tools_file_create_items(...)`
- `PowerToolsMenuMixin` did not define that helper, so startup failed during menu construction

Resolution:

- added the missing `_append_power_tools_file_create_items(...)` helper to `PowerToolsMenuMixin`
- kept behavior aligned with the merged menu intent:
  - `New Document from Clipboard` remains placed near `File > New`
- added a regression test that verifies the menu builder does not call any missing power-tools helper

Validation:

- reran the targeted startup-regression plus publishing-owned slice
- result: `40 passed in 1.85s`
- verification set:
  - `tests/unit/ui/test_main_frame_menu_contract.py`
  - `tests/unit/core/test_publishing_browse.py`
  - `tests/unit/core/test_publishing_framework.py`
  - `tests/unit/ui/test_main_frame.py`
  - `tests/unit/ui/test_publishing_connection_dialog_a11y.py`

## 2026-06-12 18:39:17 -04:00

Startup regression investigation:

- user reported an immediate startup crash after the upstream merge and later publishing work
- traceback pointed to:
  - `quill/ui/main_frame_menu.py`
  - missing `MainFrame._append_power_tools_file_create_items`
- investigation result:
  - this is not caused by the publishing slice added after the merge
  - this is an upstream/main integration bug in the split menu/mixin path
  - `MenuBuilderMixin._build_menu()` now calls `_append_power_tools_file_create_items(...)`
  - `PowerToolsMenuMixin` does not define that helper, so startup fails before the app can finish constructing
- remediation plan:
  - add the missing mixin helper
  - add a regression test so the menu builder cannot reference a missing helper again

## 2026-06-12 18:31:56 -04:00

Implementation result:

- completed the first local-to-remote publish slice after remote-update support
- added:
  - `publishing.create_draft`
  - `publishing.create_page_draft`
- both actions are command-registered so they remain command-palette-visible, not menu-only

Behavior added in this pass:

- Quill can now create a remote WordPress post draft from the current document
- Quill can now create a remote WordPress page draft from the current document
- both actions live under `File > Publish`
- both actions stay review-first with an explicit confirmation before network write-back
- successful create flows now attach publishing-remote linkage metadata to the current document so later remote-update actions can operate on the created item
- outbound content respects the same authoring-surface rule already used by remote update:
  - Markdown-authored documents render to HTML body content on send
  - explicitly HTML-authored documents send raw HTML unchanged

PRD / governance alignment check:

- commands are still real `publishing.*` commands, preserving command palette discoverability
- no new custom dialog surface was added in this slice
- the flow stays inside standard confirmation/message-box patterns, reducing dialog-governance burden
- plain-language command labels and status copy were preserved

Validation:

- reran the publishing-owned slice with the new create-draft coverage
- result: `39 passed in 1.94s`
- verification set:
  - `tests/unit/core/test_publishing_browse.py`
  - `tests/unit/core/test_publishing_framework.py`
  - `tests/unit/ui/test_main_frame.py`
  - `tests/unit/ui/test_main_frame_menu_contract.py`
  - `tests/unit/ui/test_publishing_connection_dialog_a11y.py`

## 2026-06-12 18:25:56 -04:00

Implementation start:

- resumed the next publishing slice after remote-update support
- selected the first local-to-remote publish path as the next implementation target
- scope chosen for this pass:
  - `publishing.create_draft`
  - `publishing.create_page_draft`
- current implementation intent:
  - keep these as real commands so they stay command-palette-visible
  - keep them under `File > Publish`
  - avoid a new custom dialog if the existing review/confirmation pattern is enough
  - preserve PRD rules:
    - explicit review-first network action
    - plain-language status and command names
    - accessibility-safe standard controls
    - minimal dialog-governance expansion

## 2026-06-12 18:19:18 -04:00

Planning checkpoint:

- user asked what comes next in the approved publishing flow after remote update support
- user also asked to keep checking:
  - command palette coverage
  - PRD alignment
  - accessibility requirements
  - dialog-governance requirements
- current read:
  - the new `publishing.update_remote_item` action is command-registered, so it is on the same command-path surface as the rest of Quill command palette actions
  - next likely product slice is the first explicit create/publish path for local documents rather than more remote-open/update refinement
- planning intent for the next implementation recommendation:
  - keep adding publishing actions as real commands, not menu-only actions
  - avoid unnecessary new dialogs
  - preserve review-first network consent and plain-language accessibility copy

## 2026-06-12 18:15:44 -04:00

Implementation result:

- completed the planned `Update Remote Content...` slice for publishing-remote tabs
- added provider write-back plumbing for remote publishing updates
- added the `File > Publish > Update Remote Content...` entry and command wiring

Behavior added in this pass:

- Quill now updates an opened publishing-remote post/page back to the provider when the user explicitly chooses `Update Remote Content...`
- the action only proceeds for tabs opened from publishing remote content
- the action checks that the current publishing connection still matches the opened remote item
- the action stays review-first with a confirmation summary before network write-back
- outbound content respects the saved authoring surface:
  - Markdown-authored publishing tabs are rendered to HTML body content on send
  - explicitly HTML-authored publishing tabs are sent as raw HTML unchanged
- successful update responses refresh saved remote metadata on the current document:
  - remote URL
  - publishing status
  - publishing updated-at timestamp

Validation:

- reran the publishing-owned update slice with workspace-local temp dirs
- result: `36 passed in 1.58s`
- verification set:
  - `tests/unit/core/test_publishing_browse.py`
  - `tests/unit/core/test_publishing_framework.py`
  - `tests/unit/ui/test_main_frame.py`
  - `tests/unit/ui/test_main_frame_menu_contract.py`
  - `tests/unit/ui/test_publishing_connection_dialog_a11y.py`

Notes:

- an earlier broader scoped rerun hit unrelated `tmp_path` setup issues before the workspace-local `.tmp/pytest` base existed
- no additional upstream/main failures were introduced by this publishing slice

## 2026-06-12 18:01:00 -04:00

Implementation start:

- resumed the next planned publishing slice: `Update Remote Content...`
- re-read the active publishing plan, current handoff, and current review log before coding
- confirmed the branch already preserves remote-open metadata needed for update work:
  - `source_kind`
  - `publishing_authoring_surface`
  - `publishing_open_representation`
  - provider/site/remote-id/content-kind/status metadata
- confirmed the current code gap is exactly the expected one:
  - browse/open exists
  - remote update command id exists in feature mapping
  - no remote write-back API, menu item, or UI handler exists yet
- implementation intent for this pass:
  - add provider-aware remote update support
  - convert Markdown-authored publishing tabs to HTML body content on send
  - send explicitly HTML-authored publishing tabs as raw HTML unchanged
  - keep the action explicit and review-first inside `File > Publish`

## 2026-06-12 17:43:01 -04:00

Planning checkpoint:

- user asked whether the branch is ready to carry on after the latest upstream merge/sync work
- answer: yes
- branch is in a good place for new coding work again
- focused publishing integration remains green against current `main`

Next planned implementation slice:

- `Update Remote Content...`
- use stored publishing metadata from an opened remote publishing tab
- decide update behavior from the saved authoring surface:
  - Markdown-authored remote tabs convert to HTML on send
  - explicitly HTML-authored remote tabs send raw HTML unchanged
- keep the flow explicit and review-first, consistent with the approved publishing plan

## 2026-06-12 17:30:59 -04:00

Workspace-noise cleanup:

- removed the leftover local temp/cache directories with elevated permissions:
  - `.tmp/`
  - `.pytest_cache/`
  - `codegit-srcquill.pytest_cache/`
- rechecked branch state after the cleanup
- no product-code changes were made in this pass
- this leaves the tracked tree focused on the documentation correction only

Final intent from this checkpoint:

- refresh handoff/readiness docs so they match the correction and cleanup
- commit the documentation cleanup
- push so the remote branch ends in a clean, fully documented state

## 2026-06-12 17:29:07 -04:00

Guidance-file correction:

- corrected a repo-local guidance mistake
- removed the untracked repo `AGENTS.md` file that should not have been introduced here
- reverted the repo-local `CLAUDE.md` accessibility-guidance addition
- this correction keeps repository support files focused on project artifacts rather than assistant-environment overrides

## 2026-06-12 17:27:38 -04:00

Main resync + publishing integration audit:

- reviewed current handoff, review log, readiness memory, and publishing plan before syncing
- fetched current `origin/main` and found local `main` was behind by 29 commits
- fast-forwarded local `main` to `97d04f6`
- pushed synced `main` to `fork/main`
- merged updated `main` into `features/publishing-providers-framework`

High-impact upstream themes pulled in:

- developer console / QDC work
- GitHub remote file access under `File > Open from Remote`
- autoupdate and release/deployment infrastructure
- new help, translation, setup-wizard, copy-tray, abbreviation, and prompt-library surfaces
- expanded dialog inventory, menu linting, and accessibility gates

Publishing integration review:

- preserved publishing command mappings alongside new developer-console mappings
- preserved `File > Publish` submenu while keeping newer `File > Open from Remote` GitHub items from `main`
- regenerated:
  - `tests/unit/ui/fixtures/dialog_inventory.json`
  - `tests/unit/ui/fixtures/main_frame_public_surface.json`
- updated `quill/tools/module_size_budgets.json` to reflect the merged branch truth, including explicit tracking for `quill/ui/publishing_tools.py`
- current PRD/menu read stays coherent:
  - GitHub Remote belongs under `File > Open from Remote`
  - publishing still fits cleanly as its own `File > Publish` workflow

Validation result:

- reran publishing-owned plus merge-sensitive validation slice against the new upstream baseline
- result: `129 passed in 19.12s`

Validation slice:

- `tests/unit/core/test_publishing.py`
- `tests/unit/core/test_publishing_browse.py`
- `tests/unit/core/test_publishing_framework.py`
- `tests/unit/core/test_features.py`
- `tests/unit/core/test_remote_sites.py`
- `tests/unit/ui/test_main_frame.py`
- `tests/unit/ui/test_publishing_connection_dialog_a11y.py`
- `tests/unit/ui/test_remote_sites_dialog.py`
- `tests/unit/ui/test_main_frame_characterization.py`
- `tests/unit/ui/test_main_frame_menu_contract.py`
- `tests/unit/ui/test_dialog_inventory.py`
- `tests/performance/test_budgets.py`
- `tests/unit/ui/test_main_frame_share_dialogs.py`
- `tests/unit/ui/test_power_tools_command_wiring.py`
- `tests/unit/ui/test_status_bar_layout_contract.py`
- `tests/unit/tools/test_menu_lint.py`
- `tests/unit/tools/test_check_banned_patterns.py`

## 2026-06-10 23:09:01 -04:00

Final documentation sync:

- user requested one last pass so nothing is left to do after push
- reviewed the moved log, handoff, and memory files together
- refreshed final branch-state documentation in:
  - `codex-notes/logs/codex-review-log.md`
  - `codex-notes/handoff/codex-handoff.md`
  - `codex-notes/memory/publishing-providers-framework-readiness.md`

Current branch state:

- latest pushed branch tip before this doc sync was `1b65db4`
- branch already contained:
  - merge of current `origin/main`
  - green maintained publishing/merge-sensitive test slice (`87 passed`)
  - centralized `codex-notes/` layout
- purpose of this checkpoint is to leave the remote with fully aligned support docs, not to change product behavior

Next action from this checkpoint:

- commit these final documentation updates
- push so remote branch tip and local documentation state match exactly

## 2026-06-10 23:06:36 -04:00

Clean-and-push checkpoint:

- user deleted the now-empty old folder after the Codex-notes reorganization
- checked tracked git state before committing
- tracked branch state was already clean, so the folder removal did not leave additional staged or unstaged tracked changes
- recording this checkpoint so the log reflects the final cleanup and push request

Next action from this checkpoint:

- commit this log update
- push the branch so the remote tip matches the clean local state

## 2026-06-10 23:03:19 -04:00

Codex-notes reorganization:

- committed the current merge-readiness assessment state first
- created a central `codex-notes/` folder to reduce root-folder clutter
- moved tracked Codex artifacts into:
  - `codex-notes/handoff/`
  - `codex-notes/logs/`
  - `codex-notes/memory/`
  - `codex-notes/notes/`
  - `codex-notes/plans/`
- added `codex-notes/README.md` so the new layout is self-explanatory

Files moved in this pass:

- `codex-handoff.md` -> `codex-notes/handoff/codex-handoff.md`
- `codex-review-log.md` -> `codex-notes/logs/codex-review-log.md`
- `codex-memory/publishing-providers-framework-readiness.md` -> `codex-notes/memory/publishing-providers-framework-readiness.md`
- `codex-plans/publishing-providers-framework.md` -> `codex-notes/plans/publishing-providers-framework.md`
- `main-branch-audit-note-2026-06-10.md` -> `codex-notes/notes/main-branch-audit-note-2026-06-10.md`
- `publishing-main-merge-readiness-note-2026-06-10.md` -> `codex-notes/notes/publishing-main-merge-readiness-note-2026-06-10.md`
- `publishing-remote-integration-planning-2026-06-10.md` -> `codex-notes/notes/publishing-remote-integration-planning-2026-06-10.md`

Current result:

- root is cleaner
- Codex planning/history artifacts now live under one obvious top-level folder
- no additional production-code changes were made in this cleanup pass

## 2026-06-10 22:56:23 -04:00

Repo-organization request:

- user asked for a two-step cleanup:
  - first commit the current readiness-assessment note/log state
  - then move planning, logs, handoff docs, notes, and Codex memory/planning artifacts into a central folder
- intent is repo tidiness: root is getting crowded
- next actions from this checkpoint:
  - commit current markdown state as-is
  - create a central Codex-notes location
  - move tracked note artifacts there
  - update references and log the reorganization in detail

## 2026-06-10 22:48:16 -04:00

Merge-readiness assessment:

- reviewed branch history against current `origin/main`
- checked recent upstream direction before making a recommendation
- created a dedicated note:
  - `publishing-main-merge-readiness-note-2026-06-10.md`

Current recommendation:

- do not rush this branch straight into `main` yet
- branch looks ready for draft PR / review visibility
- branch does not yet look ideal for direct merge because:
  - publishing lifecycle work is still incomplete (`Update Remote Content...` is still pending)
  - `main` is in active adjacent UI churn from notebook/menu/Node runtime work
  - the branch currently carries planning/log/handoff artifacts in addition to production code

Summary judgment:

- ready for review: yes
- ready for draft PR: yes
- ready for direct merge to `main` as-is: no

## 2026-06-10 22:27:23 -04:00

Merge-and-audit checkpoint:

- reviewed `codex-handoff.md` and `codex-review-log.md` first, then merged current `origin/main` into `features/publishing-providers-framework`
- preserved branch publishing work while integrating newer upstream notebook/menu/dialog-budget changes
- resolved merge conflicts in:
  - `quill/ui/main_frame_menu.py`
  - `quill/tools/module_size_budgets.json`
  - `tests/unit/ui/fixtures/dialog_inventory.json`
- updated `tests/unit/ui/fixtures/main_frame_public_surface.json` to include notebook public methods introduced by merged `main`
- corrected the first local test attempt after it hit sandbox temp-directory permission failures; reran the same branch-owned slice with workspace-local `TEMP`/`TMP` and cache paths

Validation result:

- maintained branch-owned publishing plus merge-sensitive verification slice is green again
- exact slice rerun:
  - `tests/unit/core/test_publishing.py`
  - `tests/unit/core/test_publishing_browse.py`
  - `tests/unit/core/test_publishing_framework.py`
  - `tests/unit/core/test_features.py`
  - `tests/unit/core/test_remote_sites.py`
  - `tests/unit/ui/test_main_frame.py`
  - `tests/unit/ui/test_publishing_connection_dialog_a11y.py`
  - `tests/unit/ui/test_remote_sites_dialog.py`
  - `tests/unit/ui/test_main_frame_characterization.py`
  - `tests/unit/ui/test_main_frame_menu_contract.py`
  - `tests/unit/ui/test_dialog_inventory.py`
  - `tests/performance/test_budgets.py`
- result: `87 passed in 9.85s`

Current recommendation:

- branch is ready for new coding work again
- next implementation slice still looks like `Update Remote Content...`
- shape that slice around the now-merged authoring-surface truth:
  - keep `Readable Markdown` as the default open path
  - preserve explicit `Raw HTML` overrides
  - use stored remote metadata to decide whether update/publish should convert Markdown to HTML or send raw HTML unchanged

## 2026-06-10 17:40:40 -04:00

Stopping-point checkpoint:

- branch is at a clean stopping point
- latest implementation work for remote-open publishing representation is already committed and pushed
- planning notes for possible future publishing/remote-site alignment are also preserved in-repo
- no outstanding tracked workspace changes remained before this doc-only wrap-up update
- intended next coding slice when work resumes:
  - explicit `Update Remote Content...` flow
  - use stored publishing metadata and authoring-surface truth for send-time conversion decisions

## 2026-06-10 17:36:42 -04:00

Commit clarification:

- user asked to proceed with the detailed commit
- that commit had already been created immediately before this message
- current detailed checkpoint commit is:
  - `00d0683` `feat(publishing): default remote opens to readable markdown`
- next actionable git step, if wanted, is push

## 2026-06-10 17:31:23 -04:00

Repo-portability checkpoint:

- user asked that the planning/log/handoff documents be committed into the repo instead of staying local-only
- reason: preserve branch context across machines and avoid losing working notes if the current environment fails
- next action from this checkpoint is a full detailed commit including:
  - current publishing representation-slice code
  - updated plan/readiness documents
  - previously untracked Codex handoff/log/planning notes

## 2026-06-10 17:24:40 -04:00

Planning-only checkpoint:

- user asked whether the newer remote-site stack from current `main` (FTP/SFTP/WebDAV/S3 and related open/save remote flows) should absorb part of the publishing framework for better synchronization
- reviewed current remote-site code, publishing code, and the active publishing plan
- created a separate planning note:
  - `publishing-remote-integration-planning-2026-06-10.md`

Current planning judgment:

- some future consolidation is worthwhile at the saved-profile / credential / trust / remote-destination infrastructure layer
- publishing should still remain separate from generic remote file transfer at the content-workflow layer
- recommendation is phased alignment, not a direct merge of the two product flows
- no code changes requested or planned from this checkpoint

## 2026-06-10 17:13:23 -04:00

Implementation slice completed:

- started and completed the planned remote-open representation work for publishing content
- added a core representation-prep helper in `quill/core/publishing.py`
- browse/open now defaults remote publishing content to `Readable Markdown`
- browse/open now allows a per-open `Raw HTML` override in `quill/ui/publishing_tools.py`
- added conservative automatic fallback to raw HTML for obviously HTML-structured content such as tables
- `quill/ui/main_frame.py` now records the chosen authoring surface and open representation from the prepared content instead of hard-coding HTML metadata
- expanded focused publishing coverage in:
  - `tests/unit/core/test_publishing_browse.py`
  - `tests/unit/ui/test_main_frame.py`
  - `tests/unit/ui/test_publishing_connection_dialog_a11y.py`

Validation result:

- maintained publishing-focused slice passed cleanly after the change
- result: 87 passed in 9.96s

What this means for next work:

- the earlier representation-choice gap is no longer the next planned task
- the next likely slice is the first explicit `Update Remote Content...` flow using the stored publishing metadata and the new Markdown-vs-HTML authoring-surface truth

## 2026-06-10 17:05:14 -04:00

Logging workflow note:

- user wants all chat output reflected in this file going forward
- includes coding updates, planning notes, checkpoint reminders, and light conversational/project guidance that affects the work
- newest entries stay at the top

## 2026-06-10 17:03:51 -04:00

Checkpoint / next-slice reminder:

- branch-owned publishing verification is in a good state to resume coding
- next planned implementation slice remains remote-open representation handling for publishing content
- current behavior still opens publishing remotes as raw HTML
- next code step is:
  - default open as `Readable Markdown`
  - allow per-open `Raw HTML` override
  - preserve explicit representation metadata for later save/update flow work
- user asked that reminder responses like this be logged going forward

## 2026-06-10 16:19:03 -04:00

Follow-up note handling:

- created a separate maintainer-facing audit note at `main-branch-audit-note-2026-06-10.md`
- preserved the earlier full-suite findings there so they can be handed to `main` maintainers without carrying unrelated fixes on this branch
- kept this branch itself scoped to the publishing slice after the revert/correction pass

## 2026-06-10 16:15:07 -04:00

Correction to the prior audit pass:

- reverted the audit-only test/code tightening I added after mistakenly running the full upstream suite
- removed that out-of-scope audit work from the tracked tree so this branch is back to validating only the feature-owned publishing slice
- kept the local notes and corrected the review approach rather than carrying unrelated upstream-suite changes forward

What I validated instead:

- reran only the branch-owned publishing/integration slice we have been maintaining:
  - `tests/unit/ui/test_main_frame_characterization.py`
  - `tests/unit/ui/test_dialog_inventory.py`
  - `tests/unit/ui/test_main_frame_menu_contract.py`
  - `tests/performance/test_budgets.py`

What I changed in this audit/tightening pass:

- ran a full-suite `pytest -q` audit after the `main` merge work
- traced the first failure wave to stale tests that still pointed `QUILL_DATA_DIR` at temp paths outside the dev-build home constraint introduced on current `main`
- added a shared `home_data_dir` fixture in `tests/conftest.py` that:
  - creates a fake home-scoped data directory
  - sets `HOME` and `USERPROFILE`
  - patches `Path.home()`
  - keeps `QUILL_DATA_DIR` inside the allowed dev override boundary
- updated the remaining stale persistence/config tests to use the home-scoped fixture:
  - `tests/integration/test_document_workflows.py`
  - `tests/unit/core/ai/test_ai_sessions.py`
  - `tests/unit/core/test_recent.py`
  - `tests/unit/core/test_recovery.py`
  - `tests/unit/core/test_ipc.py`
  - `tests/unit/core/test_keymap.py`
  - `tests/unit/core/test_menu_customization.py`
- tightened the full-suite security/perf audit tests:
  - `tests/unit/core/test_net_tls.py` now AST-parses only files that mention TLS attributes under review
  - `quill/core/thesaurus.py` now cleans each synonym once instead of twice during parse

Validation results from this pass:

- stale-failure slice re-run passed: 11 passed
- IPC/keymap/menu persistence slice re-run passed: 11 passed
- TLS audit file re-run passed: 5 passed
- thesaurus reset-cache timeout repro re-run passed in isolation: 1 passed

Full-suite status:

- full `pytest -q` no longer fails on the earlier storage-path regressions
- the suite now advances much further, but it still does not complete green in one uninterrupted run in this environment
- latest blocking point is a performance timeout during `tests/unit/core/test_reset_caches.py::test_thesaurus_preload_after_reset_is_idempotent`
- that test passes in isolation, so the remaining issue is currently a suite-run timeout/perf characteristic rather than a confirmed functional regression

Planning/audit conclusion:

- publishing branch behavior still aligns with the post-merge plan after these fixes
- no new publishing-architecture mismatch was found in this audit pass
- if we get the full suite consistently green, the next recommended coding slice is still the planned remote-open representation work:
  - default remote publishing opens to `Readable Markdown`
  - allow explicit `Raw HTML` override
  - preserve representation/authoring metadata for later update flow

## 2026-06-10

What I changed in this main-resync and merge pass:

- reviewed `codex-review-log.md` and `codex-handoff.md`
- confirmed local `main` was behind `origin/main` by 4 commits
- stashed local branch work so the resync and merge could happen safely
- fast-forwarded local `main` to `origin/main`
- pushed updated `main` to `fork/main`
- merged updated `main` into `features/publishing-providers-framework`
- resolved merge conflicts in:
  - `quill/tools/module_size_budgets.json`
  - `tests/unit/ui/fixtures/dialog_inventory.json`
  - `tests/unit/ui/fixtures/main_frame_public_surface.json`
- regenerated:
  - `tests/unit/ui/fixtures/dialog_inventory.json`
  - `tests/unit/ui/fixtures/main_frame_public_surface.json`
- reapplied the publishing-branch tighten-ups on top of the new merged tree:
  - `quill/ui/main_frame.py`
  - `tests/unit/core/test_publishing.py`
  - `tests/unit/core/test_features.py`
  - `tests/unit/ui/test_main_frame.py`
  - `dialogs.md`
  - `codex-memory/publishing-providers-framework-readiness.md`
  - `codex-plans/publishing-providers-framework.md`

What changed from `main` that mattered to this branch:

- upstream added a significant Remote Sites feature set with new remote transport/core/dialog surfaces
- upstream also changed:
  - dialog inventory
  - main-frame public surface
  - menu wiring
  - network-egress audit
  - module-size budget baselines
- this merge therefore had to be treated as a real integration pass, not just a routine sync

Implementation/maintenance result:

- new merge commit created: `47d5ff7` (`Merge main into features/publishing-providers-framework`)
- local `main`, `origin/main`, and `fork/main` now match at `d27b364`

Why this was needed:

- `main` had moved again after the previous sync
- the feature branch needed the latest upstream shell and contract changes merged in before more publishing work continues
- the newer upstream Remote Sites changes touched several of the same UI-governance surfaces that publishing also uses

Validation run:

- `tests/unit/ui/test_main_frame_characterization.py`
- `tests/unit/ui/test_dialog_inventory.py`
- `tests/unit/ui/test_main_frame_menu_contract.py`
- `tests/performance/test_budgets.py`
- `tests/unit/core/test_publishing.py`
- `tests/unit/core/test_publishing_browse.py`
- `tests/unit/core/test_publishing_framework.py`
- `tests/unit/core/test_features.py`
- `tests/unit/ui/test_publishing_connection_dialog_a11y.py`
- `tests/unit/ui/test_main_frame.py`
- `tests/unit/core/test_remote_sites.py`
- `tests/unit/ui/test_remote_sites_dialog.py`
- result: 84 tests passed

Plan/document follow-up:

- the publishing plan file remains correct in direction, but now explicitly sits beside a newer upstream Remote Sites shell pattern that may be worth borrowing from in later implementation slices
- the readiness note and dialog checklist were updated to stay aligned with the real merged branch state

## 2026-06-10

What I changed in this follow-up audit pass:

- audited the publishing branch against the newly merged `main`
- verified that the implemented publishing work still matches the approved architecture in core, menu, dialog, feature, and egress-review seams
- identified the main remaining drift: remote-open representation is still raw HTML only, while the approved plan calls for `Readable Markdown` by default plus explicit `Raw HTML` override/fallback
- tightened the interim implementation by recording explicit remote-open metadata in `quill/ui/main_frame.py`:
  - `source_kind = publishing_remote`
  - `publishing_authoring_surface = html`
  - `publishing_open_representation = raw_html`
- updated:
  - `dialogs.md`
  - `codex-memory/publishing-providers-framework-readiness.md`
  - `codex-plans/publishing-providers-framework.md`
## 2026-06-14

What I changed in this pass:

- restored `CLAUDE.md` fully from `main`
- ran a broader merge-sensitive verification pass around the `main` surfaces that publishing extends
- restored `CLAUDE.md` from `main` so the branch no longer carries the duplicated response-heading guidance
- reran the publishing-owned verification slice against the merged publishing branch
- updated `codex-notes/handoff/codex-handoff.md`

Why this was needed:

- the heading/accessibility rule is already being carried by local `AGENTS.md`, so `CLAUDE.md` should not drift on the branch
- after the large `main` merge, we needed one more truthful pass focused on the code and governance surfaces owned by the publishing work
- the notes needed to reflect the newest verified checkpoint
- after the targeted publishing-owned pass, we still wanted confidence that the newer `main` shell work and our publishing integration were coexisting cleanly where they touch

- result: `424 passed in 36.44s`

  - `codex-handoff.md`
- added a focused regression assertion in `tests/unit/ui/test_main_frame.py`
- updated older publishing and feature tests to honor the current dev-only `QUILL_DATA_DIR` override contract from `quill/core/paths.py`

Why this was needed:

- several local memory/checklist files still described the pre-merge or pre-implementation state
- the code needed a more explicit interim contract so later update/publish flows do not have to guess whether a remotely opened document is HTML-authored

Validation run for this pass:

- `tests/unit/core/test_publishing.py`
- `tests/unit/core/test_publishing_browse.py`
- `tests/unit/core/test_publishing_framework.py`
- `tests/unit/core/test_features.py`
- `tests/unit/ui/test_publishing_connection_dialog_a11y.py`
- `tests/unit/ui/test_main_frame.py`
- result: 53 tests passed

What I changed in this pass:

- synced local `main` to `origin/main`
- pushed `main` to `fork/main`
- merged `main` into `features/publishing-providers-framework`
- updated merge-resolution files:
  - `quill/tools/module_size_budgets.json`
  - `quill/tools/ui_surface.py`
  - `tests/unit/ui/fixtures/dialog_inventory.json`
  - `tests/unit/ui/fixtures/main_frame_public_surface.json`
  - `tests/unit/ui/test_main_frame_menu_contract.py`
- restored local planning notes after the merge

Implementation/maintenance result:

- merge commit created: `23b8adf` (`Merge main into features/publishing-providers-framework`)
- `fork/main` now matches `origin/main` at `c43ff0f`

Why this was needed:

- `origin/main` had moved substantially ahead of the fork
- the feature branch needed the latest upstream changes without losing planning work already in progress
- the conflicting UI-surface snapshots and menu-contract helpers needed a truthful merged baseline

Validation run:

- `.venv\Scripts\pytest.exe tests/unit/ui/test_main_frame_characterization.py tests/unit/ui/test_dialog_inventory.py tests/unit/ui/test_main_frame_menu_contract.py tests/performance/test_budgets.py`

What to check when resuming:

- `codex-handoff.md`
- `codex-review-log.md`
- `codex-plans/publishing-providers-framework.md`
- current branch status for any uncommitted planning-note edits

## 2026-06-09

What I changed in this pass:

- updated `codex-plans/publishing-providers-framework.md`
- no implementation code changed
- no tests changed
- no commit created in this pass

Planning decision added:

- convert only clearly text-first HTML to `Readable Markdown`
- fall back to `Raw HTML` for anything that looks interactive, embedded, layout-heavy, or structurally rich

Why this was added:

- to keep remote-open conversion honest
- to avoid lossy Markdown flattening for HTML-native structures
- to make later update and publish behavior easier to explain clearly

What to check when resuming:

- `codex-handoff.md`
- `codex-review-log.md`
