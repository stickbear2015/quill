"""Root test configuration.

Activates the ``_DEV_BUILD`` flag in :mod:`quill.core.paths` for the entire
test suite so that ``QUILL_DATA_DIR`` overrides (used by almost every test
fixture for isolation) are honoured.  Without this flag the guard added by
H-1-core silently ignores ``QUILL_DATA_DIR`` in non-dev builds, causing tests
to write to the real ``%APPDATA%\\Quill`` path and fail with stale state.
